Different machine learning algorithms suit different goals, such as classification or prediction modeling, so data scientists use different algorithms as the basis for different models. As you introduce data to a specific algorithm, it is modified to better manage a specific task and becomes a machine learning model. A data scientist looking to create a machine learning model that identifies different animal species might train a decision tree algorithm with various animal images. You can create machine learning models by training algorithms with either labeled data, unlabeled data, or a mix of both.\u001b[0m\n",

Machine learning models can be broadly categorized into four main paradigms based on the type of data and learning goals: After learning these patterns, the model is then capable of assigning these class labels to unseen data points. *Model Represntation:* Machine Learning Models are represented by mathematical functions that map input data to output predictions. Additionally, machine learning models need to be updated and restarted to understand new data patterns. Machine Learning Tutorial Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.'}, {'url': 'https://www.coursera.org/articles/machine-learning-models', 'content': 'Machine Learning Models and How to Build Them | Coursera You create machine learning models by using machine learning algorithms, which undergo a training process using either labeled, unlabeled, or mixed data. Different machine learning algorithms suit different goals, such as classification or prediction modeling, so data scientists use different algorithms as the basis for different models. As you introduce data to a specific algorithm, it is modified to better manage a specific task and becomes a machine learning model. A data scientist looking to create a machine learning model that identifies different animal species might train a decision tree algorithm with various animal images. You can create machine learning models by training algorithms with either labeled data, unlabeled data, or a mix of both.'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning', 'content': 'Jump to content Search Toggle the table of contents Kohavi and F. massive.io. ^ Alpaydin, Ethem (2010). ^ Alpaydin, Ethem (2010). hazyresearch.github.io.

      "Activity recognition aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. Since the 1980s, this research field has captured the attention of several computer science communities due to its strength in providing personalized support for many different applications and its connection to many different fields of study such as medicine, human-computer interaction, or sociology.\n",
      "Due to its multifaceted nature, different fields may refer to activity recognition as plan recognition, goal recognition, intent recognition, behavior recognition, location estimation and location-based services.\n",

      "Sensor-based, single-user activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Sensor-based activity recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel data mining and machine learning techniques to model a wide range of human activities.[1][2] Mobile devices (e.g. smart phones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life. Sensor-based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering ubiquitous computers and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents (under consent), these computers will be better suited to act on our behalf. Visual sensors that incorporate color and depth information, such as the Kinect, allow more accurate automatic action recognition and fuse many emerging applications such as interactive education[3] and smart environments.[4] Multiple views of visual sensor enable the development of machine learning for automatic view invariant action recognition.[5] More advanced sensors used in 3D motion capture systems allow highly accurate automatic recognition, in the expenses of more complicated hardware system setup.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Levels of sensor-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Sensor-based activity recognition is a challenging task due to the inherent noisy nature of the input. Thus, statistical modeling has been the main thrust in this direction in layers, where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected. At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data. At an intermediate level, statistical inference may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels. Furthermore, at the highest level, a major concern is to find out the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensor-based, multi-user activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Recognizing activities for multiple users using on-body sensors first appeared in the work by ORL using active badge systems[7] in the early 1990s. Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios.[8] Activities of Multiple Users in intelligent environments are addressed in Gu et al.[9] In this work, they investigate the fundamental problem of recognizing activities for multiple users from sensor readings in a home environment, and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize both single-user and multi-user activities in a unified solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensor-based group activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Recognition of group activities is fundamentally different from single, or multi-user activity recognition in that the goal is to recognize the behavior of the group as an entity, rather than the activities of the individual members within it.[10]  Group behavior is emergent in nature, meaning that the properties of the behavior of the group are fundamentally different than the properties of the behavior of the individuals within it, or any sum of that behavior.[11]  The main challenges are in modeling the behavior of the individual group members, as well as the roles of the individual within the group dynamic[12] and their relationship to emergent behavior of the group in parallel.[13]  Challenges which must still be addressed include quantification of the behavior and roles of individuals who join the group, integration of explicit models for role description into inference algorithms, and scalability evaluations for very large groups and crowds.  Group activity recognition has applications for crowd management and response in emergency situations, as well as for social networking and Quantified Self applications.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaches[edit]\n",
      "Activity recognition through logic and reasoning[edit]\n",
      "Logic-based approaches keep track of all logically consistent explanations of the observed actions. Thus, all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered. Kautz provided a formal theory of plan recognition. He described plan recognition as a logical inference process of circumscription. All actions and plans are uniformly referred to as goals, and a recognizer's knowledge is represented by a set of first-order statements, called event hierarchy.  Event hierarchy is encoded in first-order logic, which defines abstraction, decomposition and functional relationships between types of events.[15]\n",
      "Kautz's general framework for plan recognition has an exponential time complexity in worst case, measured in the size of the input hierarchy. Lesh and Etzioni went one step further and presented methods in scaling up goal recognition to scale up his work computationally. In contrast to Kautz's approach where the plan library is explicitly represented, Lesh and Etzioni's approach enables automatic plan-library construction from domain primitives. Furthermore, they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries.[16]\n",
      "Inconsistent plans and goals are repeatedly pruned when new actions arrive. Besides, they also presented methods for adapting a goal recognizer to handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given a sample of an individual's recent behavior. Pollack et al. described a direct argumentation model that can know about the relative strength of several kinds of arguments for belief and intention description.\n",
      "A serious problem of logic-based approaches is their inability or inherent infeasibility to represent uncertainty. They offer no mechanism for preferring one consistent approach to another and are incapable of deciding whether one particular plan is more likely than another, as long as both of them can be consistent enough to explain the actions observed. There is also a lack of learning ability associated with logic based methods.\n",
      "Another approach to logic-based activity recognition is to use stream reasoning based on answer set programming,[17] and has been applied to recognising activities for health-related applications,[18]  which uses weak constraints to model a degree of ambiguity/uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning[edit]\n",
      "Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions, plans and goals under uncertainty.[19] In the literature, there have been several approaches which explicitly represent uncertainty in reasoning about an agent's plans and goals.\n",
      "Using sensor data as input, Hodges and Pollack designed machine learning-based systems for identifying individuals as they perform routine daily activities such as making coffee.[20] Intel Research (Seattle) Lab and University of Washington at Seattle have done some important works on using sensors to detect human plans.[21][22][23] Some of these works infer user transportation modes from readings of radio-frequency identifiers (RFID) and global positioning systems (GPS).\n",
      "The use of temporal probabilistic models has been shown to perform well in activity recognition and generally outperform non-temporal models.[24] Generative models such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the more generally formulated Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) are popular choices in modelling activities from sensor data.[25][26][27][28]\n",
      "Discriminative models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are also commonly applied and also give good performance in activity recognition.[29][30]\n",
      "Generative and discriminative models both have their pros and cons and the ideal choice depends on their area of application. A dataset together with implementations of a number of popular models (HMM, CRF) for activity recognition can be found here.\n",
      "Conventional temporal probabilistic models such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model the correlations between the activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data.[26][31][32] The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing a stir fry, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs)[31] and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining based approach to activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Different from traditional machine learning approaches, an approach based on data mining has been recently proposed. In the work of Gu et al., the problem of activity recognition is formulated as a pattern-based classification problem. They proposed a data mining approach based on discriminative patterns which describe significant changes between any two activity classes of data to recognize sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities in a unified solution.[33] Gilbert et al. use 2D corners in both space and time. These are grouped spatially and temporally using a hierarchical process, with an increasing search area. At each stage of the hierarchy, the most distinctive and descriptive features are learned efficiently through data mining (Apriori rule).[34]\n",
      "\n",
      "GPS-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Location-based activity recognition can also rely on GPS data to recognize activities.[35][36]\n",

      "Sensor usage[edit]\n",
      "Vision-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "It is a very important and challenging problem to track and understand the behavior of agents through videos taken by various cameras. The primary technique employed is Computer Vision. Vision-based activity recognition has found many applications such as human-computer interaction, user interface design, robot learning, and surveillance, among others.\n",
      "Scientific conferences where vision based activity recognition work often appears are ICCV and CVPR.\n",
      "In vision-based activity recognition, a great deal of work has been done. Researchers have attempted a number of methods such as optical flow, Kalman filtering, Hidden Markov models, etc., under different modalities such as single camera, stereo, and infrared. In addition, researchers have considered multiple aspects on this topic, including single pedestrian tracking, group tracking, and detecting dropped objects.\n",
      "Recently some researchers have used RGBD cameras like Microsoft Kinect to detect human activities.[37] Depth cameras add extra dimension i.e. depth which normal 2d camera fails to provide. Sensory information from these depth cameras have been used to generate real-time skeleton model of humans with different body positions.[38] This skeleton information provides meaningful information that researchers have used to model human activities which are trained and later used to recognize unknown activities.[39][40]\n",
      "With the recent emergency of deep learning, RGB video based activity recognition has seen rapid development. It uses videos captured by RGB cameras as input and perform several tasks, including: video classification, detection of activity start and end in videos, and spatial-temporal localization of activity and the people performing the activity.[41] Pose estimation methods[42] allow extracting more representative skeletal features for action recognition.[43] That said, it has been discovered that deep learning based action recognition may suffer from adversarial attacks, where an attacker alter the input insignificantly to fool an action recognition system.[44]\n",
      "Despite remarkable progress of vision-based activity recognition, its usage for most actual visual surveillance applications remains a distant aspiration.[45] Conversely, the human brain seems to have perfected the ability to recognize human actions. This capability relies not only on acquired knowledge, but also on the aptitude of extracting information relevant to a given context and logical reasoning. Based on this observation, it has been proposed to enhance vision-based activity recognition systems by integrating commonsense reasoning and, contextual and commonsense knowledge.\n",
      "Hierarchical Human Activity (HAR) Recognition\n",
      "Hierarchical human activity recognition is a technique within computer vision and machine learning. It aims to identify and comprehend human actions or behaviors from visual data. This method entails structuring activities hierarchically, creating a framework that represents connections and interdependencies among various actions.[46] HAR techniques can be used to understand data correlations and model fundamentals to improve models, to balance accuracy and privacy concerns in sensitive application areas, and to identify and manage trivial labels that have no relevance in specific use cases.[47]\n",
      "\n",
      "Levels of vision-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "In vision-based activity recognition, the computational process is often divided into four steps, namely human detection, human tracking, human activity recognition and then a high-level activity evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine-grained action localization[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Object co-segmentation\n",
      "In computer vision-based activity recognition, fine-grained action localization typically provides per-image segmentation masks delineating the human object and its action category (e.g., Segment-Tube[48]). Techniques such as dynamic Markov Networks, CNN and LSTM are often employed to exploit the semantic correlations between consecutive video frames. Geometric fine-grained features such as objective bounding boxes and human poses facilitate activity recognition with graph neural network.[41][49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Automatic gait recognition[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Gait recognition\n",
      "One way to identify specific people is by how they walk. Gait-recognition software can be used to record a person's gait or gait feature profile in a database for the purpose of recognizing that person later, even if they are wearing a disguise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wi-Fi-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "When activity recognition is performed indoors and in cities using the widely available Wi-Fi signals and 802.11 access points, there is much noise and uncertainty. These uncertainties can be modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network model.[50] In a multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals, a deterministic state transition model is applied.[51] Another possible method models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach.[52] A user action discovery model could segment Wi-Fi signals to produce possible actions.[53]\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic models of Wi-Fi recognition[edit]\n",
      "One of the primary thought of Wi-Fi activity recognition is that when the signal goes through the human body during transmission; which causes reflection, diffraction, and scattering. Researchers can get information from these signals to analyze the activity of the human body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Static transmission model[edit]\n",
      "As shown in,[54] when wireless signals are transmitted indoors, obstacles such as walls, the ground, and the human body cause various effects such as reflection, scattering, diffraction, and diffraction. Therefore, receiving end receives multiple signals from different paths at the same time, because surfaces reflect the signal during the transmission, which is known as multipath effect.\n",
      "The static model is based on these two kinds of signals: the direct signal and the reflected signal. Because there is no obstacle in the direct path, direct signal transmission can be modeled by Friis transmission equation:\n",

      "When a person is moving across different Fresnel zones, the signal path formed by the reflection of the human body changes, and if people move vertically through Fresnel zones, the change of signal will be periodic. In a pair of papers, Wang et.al. applied the Fresnel model to the activity recognition task and got a more accurate result.[56][57]\n",

So the difference between the radius of that two cylinders represents the moving distance during breathing.  \n",

      "HMDB51: This is a collection of realistic videos from various sources, including movies and web videos. The dataset is composed of 6,849 video clips from 51 action categories (such as “jump”, “kiss” and “laugh”), with each category containing at least 101 clips.[59]\n",
      "Kinetics: This is a significantly larger dataset than the previous ones. It contains 400 human action classes, with at least 400 video clips for each action. Each clip lasts around 10s and is taken from a different YouTube video. This dataset was created by DeepMind.[60]\n",
      "Applications[edit]\n",
      "By automatically monitoring human activities, home-based rehabilitation can be provided for people suffering from traumatic brain injuries. One can find applications ranging from security-related applications and logistics support to location-based services.[61] Activity recognition systems have been developed for wildlife observation[62] and energy conservation in buildings.[63]\n",

Just as we use sight, sound, and touch to interpret the world, these datasets combine various data formats—text, images, audio, and video—to offer a richer understanding of content.Think of it this way: if you tried to understand a movie just by reading the script, you'd miss out on the visual and auditory elements that make the story come alive. Multimodal datasets provide those missing pieces, allowing AI to catch subtleties and context that would be lost if it were limited to a single type of data. Another example is analyzing medical images alongside patient records. This approach can reveal patterns that might be missed if each type of data were examined separately, leading to breakthroughs in diagnosing diseases. It's like assembling multiple puzzle pieces to create a clearer, more comprehensive picture.In this blog, we've gathered the best multimodal datasets with links to these data sources. These datasets are crucial for Multimodal Deep Learning, which requires integrating multiple data sources to enhance performance in tasks such as image captioning, sentiment analysis, medical diagnostics, video analysis, speech recognition, emotion recognition, autonomous vehicles, and cross-modal retrieval.What is Multimodal Deep Learning?Multimodal deep learning, a subfield of Machine Learning, involves using deep learning techniques to analyze and integrate data from multiple data sources and modalities such as text, images, audio, and video simultaneously. This approach uses the complementary information from different types of data to improve model performance, enabling tasks like enhanced image captioning, audio-visual speech recognition, and cross-modal retrieval.Next-GPT: A Multimodal LLMBenefits of Multimodal Datasets in Computer VisionMultimodal datasets significantly enhance computer vision applications by providing richer and more contextual information. Here's how:   By combining visual data with other modalities and data sources like text, audio, or depth information, models can achieve higher accuracy in tasks such as object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.   Multimodal models are less susceptible to noise or variations in a single modality. For instance, combining visual and textual data can help in overcoming challenges like occlusions or ambiguous image content.Multimodal datasets allow models to learn deeper semantic relationships between objects and their context. This enables more sophisticated tasks like visual question answering (VQA) and image generation.   Multimodal dataset opens up possibilities for novel applications in computer vision, large language models, augmented reality, robotics, text-to-image generation, VQA, NLP and medical image analysis.By integrating information from data sources of different modalities, models can better understand the context of visual data, leading to more intelligent and human-like large language models.Top 10 Multimodal DatasetsFlickr30K Entities DatasetThe Flickr30K Entities dataset is an extension of the popular Flickr30K dataset, specifically designed to improve research in automatic image description and understand how language refers to objects in images. It provides more detailed annotations for image-text understanding tasks. Flickr30K Entities dataset built upon the Flickr30k dataset, which contains 31K+ images collected from Flickr. Each image in Flickr30k Entities is associated with five crowd-sourced captions describing the image content. The dataset adds bounding box annotations for all entities (people, objects, etc.) mentioned in the image captions. Flickr30K allows to develop better large language models with vision capabilities for image captioning, where the model can not only describe the image content but also pinpoint the location of the entities being described. It also allows the development of an improved grounded language understanding, which refers to a machine's ability to understand language in relation to the physical world.Research Paper: Flickr30k Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence ModelsAuthors: Bryan A. Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M. Cervantes, Juan C. Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana LazebnikDataset Size: 31,783 real-world images, 158,915 captions (5 per image), approximately 275,000 bounding boxes, 44,518 unique entity instances.Licence: The dataset typically follows the original Flickr30k dataset licence, which allows for research and academic use on non-commercial projects. However, you should verify the current licensing terms as they may have changed.Access Links: Bryan A. Plummer WebsiteVisual GenomeThe Visual Genome dataset is a multimodal dataset, bridging the gap between image content and textual descriptions. It offers a rich resource for researchers working in areas like image understanding, VQA, and multimodal learning. Visual Genome combines two modalities, first is Visual, containing over 108,000 images from the MSCOCO dataset are used as the visual component, and second is Textual, where images are extensively annotated with textual information (i.e. objects, relationships, region captions, question-answer pairs).The multimodal nature of this dataset offers advantages like deeper image understanding to allow identify meaning and relationships between objects in a scene beyond simple object detection, VQA to understand the context and answer questions that require reasoning about the visual content, and multimodal learning that can learn from both visual and textual data.Research Paper: Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image AnnotationsAuthors: Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A.

The text reviews are presented as spoken language, captured in the video recordings, audio consists of vocal qualities (like tone, pitch, and emphasis) to reveal emotional aspects of the review beyond just the spoken words, and video consists of facial expressions, gestures, and overall body language provide additional cues to the reviewer's sentiment.MuSe-CaR aims to advance research in multimodal sentiment analysis by providing a rich dataset for training and evaluating models capable of understanding complex human emotions and opinions expressed through various modalities.Research Paper: The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Car Reviews (MuSe-CaR) Dataset: Collection, Insights and ImprovementsAuthors: Lukas Stappen, Alice Baird, Lea Schumann, Björn SchullerDataset Size: 40 hours of user-generated video material with more than 350 reviews and 70 host speakers (as well as 20 overdubbed narrators) from YouTube.Licence: End User Licence Agreement (EULA)Access Links: Muse Challenge WebsiteCLEVRCLEVR, which stands for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning, is a multimodal dataset designed to evaluate a machine learning model's ability to reason about the physical world using both visual information and natural language. It is a synthetic multimodal dataset created to test AI systems' ability to perform complex reasoning about visual scenes. CLEVR combines two modalities, visual and textual. Visual modality comprises rendered 3D scenes containing various objects. Each scene features a simple background and a set of objects with distinct properties like shape (cube, sphere, cylinder), size (large, small), color (gray, red, blue, etc.), and material (rubber, metal).  Textual modality consists of questions posed in natural language about the scene. These questions challenge models to not only \"see\" the objects but also understand their relationships and properties to answer accurately.CLEVR is used in applications like visual reasoning in robotics and other domains to understand the spatial relationships between objects in real-time (e.g., \"Which object is in front of the blue rubber cube?\"), counting and comparison to enumerate objects with specific properties (e.g., \"How many small spheres are there?\"), and  logical reasoning to understand the scene and the question to arrive at the correct answer, even if the answer isn't directly visible (e.g., \"The rubber object is entirely behind a cube. What color is it?\").Research Paper: CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual ReasoningAuthors: Justin Johnson, Bharath Hariharan, Laurens van der Maaten, Fei-Fei Li, Larry Zitnick, Ross GirshickDataset Size: 100,000  images, 864986 questions, 849,980 answers, 85,000 scene graph annotations and functional program representations.Licence: Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 licence.Access Links: Stanford University CLEVR PageInternVid InternVid is a relatively new multimodal dataset specifically designed for tasks related to video understanding and generation using generative models.

      "             min read—Dec 15, 2022Learn how multimodal deep learning works. See the challenges of using multimodal datasets, and how deep learning models process multimodal inputs.Konstantinos PoulinakisGuest AuthorHumans use five senses to experience and interpret the world around them. Our five senses capture information from five different sources, and five different modalities. A modality refers to the way in which something happens, is experienced, or captured. AI is on a quest to mimic the human brain.Human brains consist of neural networks that can process multiple modalities simultaneously. Imagine having a conversation—your brain’s neural networks process multimodal inputs (audio, vision, text, odors). After a deep subconscious modality fusion, you can reason about what your interlocutor is saying, their emotional state, and your/their surroundings. This allows for a more holistic view and deeper comprehension of the situation. For artificial intelligence to match human intelligence, it's imperative that it learns to interpret, reason, and fuse multimodal information. One of the latest and most promising trends in Deep Learning research is Multimodal Deep Learning. In this article, we demystify multimodal deep learning. We discuss multimodal fusion, multimodal datasets, multimodal applications, and explain how machine learning models that perceive the world more holistically are built.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Multimodal Deep LearningMultimodal Learning ChallengesHow Multimodal Learning worksFive Multimodal Deep Learning applicationsData extraction powered by AIAutomate data extractionGet started todayExplore V7 GoData extraction powered by AIAutomate data extractionGet started todayExplore V7 GoReady to streamline AI product deployment right away?

Multimodal Deep Learning is a machine learning subfield that aims to train AI models to process and find relationships between different types of data (modalities)—typically, images, video, audio, and text. By combining different modalities, a deep learning model can comprehend its environment more universally since some cues exist only in certain modalities. Imagine the task of emotion recognition. There is more to it than just looking at a human face (visual modality). The tone and pitch of a person’s voice (audio modality) encode enormous amounts of information about their emotional state, which might not be visible through their facial expressions, even if they are often in sync. Unimodal or Monomodal models, models that process only a single modality, have been researched to a great extent and have provided extraordinary results in advancing fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, unimodal deep learning has limited capabilities, so the need for multimodal models arises. The image below is an example of how unimodal models fail in some tasks, like recognizing sarcasm or hate speech. The figure is part of META’s multimodal dataset “Hateful Memes”.Combining image and text to create a sarcastic meme. Unimodal models are unable to perceive such kind of sarcasm since each individual modality contains just half the information. In contrast, a multimodal model that processes both text and images can relate the two and discover the deeper meaning. (source)Multimodal models, more often than not, rely on deep neural networks even though other machine learning models, such as hidden Markov models HMM or Restricted Boltzman Machines RBM have been incorporated in earlier research. In multimodal deep learning, the most typical modalities are visual (images, videos), textual, and auditory (voice, sounds, music). However, other less typical modalities include 3D visual data, depth sensor data, and LiDAR data (typical in self-driving cars). In clinical practice, imaging modalities include computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, while non-image modalities include electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Sensor data like thermal data or data from eye-tracking devices can also be included in the list. Any combination of the above unimodal data results in a multimodal dataset. For example, combiningVideo + LiDAR+ depth data creates an excellent dataset for self-driving car applications. EEG  + eye tracking device data, creates a multimodal dataset that connects eye movements with brain activity. However, the most popular combinations are combinations of the three most popular modalitiesImage + Text Image + AudioImage + Text + AudioText + Audio Multimodal Learning ChallengesMultimodal deep learning aims to solve five core challenges that are active areas of research. Solutions or improvements on any of the below challenges will advance multimodal AI research and practice.RepresentationMultimodal representation is the task of encoding data from multiple modalities in the form of a vector or tensor. Good representations that capture semantic information of raw data are very important for the success of machine learning models. However, feature extraction from heterogeneous data in a way that exploits the synergies between them is very hard. Moreover, fully exploiting the complementarity of different modalities and not paying attention to redundant information is essential.  Multimodal representations fall into two categories. 1. Joint representation: each individual modality is encoded and then placed into a mutual high dimensional space. This is the most direct way and may work well when modalities are of similar nature.2. Coordinated representation: each individual modality is encoded irrespective of one another, but their representations are then coordinated by imposing a restriction. For example, their linear projections should be maximally correlated‍$$(u*,v*) = argmaxu,v(u^TX,v^TY)$$‍where X, Y denote input modalities, $(u^T, v^T)$ denote matrices that transfer input modalities to some representation space and $(u^*, v^*)$ denote the desired representation matrices that transfer inputs to a mutual representation space after the restriction has been imposed.FusionFusion is the task of joining information from two or more modalities to perform a prediction task. Effective fusion of multiple modalities, such as video, speech, and text, is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data. Fusing heterogeneous information is the core of multimodal research but comes with a big set of challenges. Practical challenges involve solving problems such as different formats, different lengths, and non-synchronized data. Theoretical challenges involve finding the most optimal fusion technique. Options include simple operations such as concatenation or weighted sum, and more sophisticated attention mechanisms such as transformer networks, or attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs).Finally, one may also need to choose between early or late fusion. In early fusion, features are integrated immediately after feature extraction with some of the above fusion mechanisms. On the other hand, during late fusion, integration is performed only after each unimodal network outputs a prediction (classification, regression). Voting schemes, weighted averages, and other techniques or usually used on late fusion. Hybrid fusion techniques have also been proposed. These combine outputs from early fusion and unimodal predictors. AlignmentAlignment refers to the task of identifying direct relationships between different modalities. Current research in multimodal learning aims to create modality-invariant representations. This means that when different modalities refer to a similar semantic concept, their representations must be similar/close together in a latent space. For example, the sentence “she dived into the pool”, an image of a pool, and the audio signal of a splash sound should lie close together in a manifold of the representation space.TranslationTranslating is the act of mapping one modality to another. The main idea is how one modality (e.g., textual modality) can be translated to another (e.g., visual modalities) while retaining the semantic meaning. Translations, however, are open-ended, subjective, and no perfect answer exists, which adds to the complexity of the task.Part of the current research in multimodal learning is to construct generative models that make translations between different modalities. The recent DALL-E and other text-to-image models are great examples of such generative models that translate text modalities to visual modalities.Read more: If you’re interested in the subject of using AI for creating works of art, read our article  AI-Generated Art: From Text to Images & BeyondCo-LearningMultimodal Co-learning aims to transfer information learned through one or more modalities to tasks involving another. Co-learning is especially important in cases of low-resource target tasks, fully/partly missing or noisy modalities. Translation—explained in the section above—may be used as a method of co-learning to transfer knowledge from one modality to another. Neuroscience suggests that humans may use methods of co-learning through translation, as well. People who suffer from aphantasia, the inability to create mental images in their heads, perform worse on memory tests. The opposite is also true, people who do create such mappings, textual/auditory to visual, perform better on memory tests. This suggests that being able to convert representations between different modalities is an important aspect of human cognition and memory.How does Multimodal Learning workMultimodal neural networks are usually a combination of multiple unimodal neural networks. For example, an audiovisual model might consist of two unimodal networks, one for visual data and one for audio data. These unimodal neural networks usually process their inputs separately. This process is called encoding. After unimodal encoding takes place, the information extracted from each model must be fused together. Multiple fusion techniques have been proposed that range from simple concatenation to attention mechanisms. The process of multimodal data fusion is one of the most important success factors. After fusion takes place, a final “decision” network accepts the fused encoded information and is trained on the end task.To put it simply, multimodal architectures usually consist of three parts:Unimodal encoders that encode individual modalities. Usually, one for each input modality.A fusion network that combines the features extracted from each input modality, during the encoding phase.A classifier that accepts the fused data and makes predictions.We refer to the above as the encoding module (DL Module in the image below), fusion module, and classification module. Workflow of a typical multimodal. Three unimodal neural networks encode the different input modalities independently. After feature extraction, fusion modules combine the different modalities (optionally in pairs), and finally, the fused features are inserted into a classification network.Let’s now dive a little deeper into each component.Encoding During encoding, we seek to create meaningful representations. Usually, each individual modality is handled by a different monomodal encoder. However, it’s often the case that the inputs are in the form of embeddings instead of their raw form. For example, word2vec embeddings may be used for text, and COVAREP embeddings for audio. Multimodal embeddings such as data2veq, which translate video, text, and audio data into embeddings in a high dimensional space, are one of the latest practices and have outperformed other embeddings achieving SOTA performance in many tasks.Deciding whether it's more suitable to use joint representations or coordinated representations (explained in the representation challenge) is an important decision. Usually, a joint representation method works well when modalities are similar in nature, and it’s the one most often used. In practice when designing multimodal networks, encoders are chosen based on what works well in each area since more emphasis is given to designing the fusion method. Many research papers use the all-time-classic ResNets for the visual modalities and RoBERTA for text. Read more: Learn more about supervised vs. unsupervised learning and see examples of each. FusionThe fusion module is responsible for combining each individual modality after feature extraction is completed. The method/architecture used for fusion is probably the most important ingredient for success.The simplest method is to use simple operations such as concatenating or summing the different unimodal representations. However, more sophisticated and successful methods have been researched and implemented. For example, the cross-attention layer mechanism is one of the more recent and successful fusion methods. It has been used to capture cross-modal interactions and fuse modalities in a more meaningful way. The equation below describes the cross-attention mechanism and assumes basic familiarity with self-attention.$$\\alpha_{kl} = s(\\frac{K_lQ_k}{\\sqrt{d}})V_l‍$$Where $\\alpha_{kl}$ denotes the attention score vector, $s(.)$ denotes the softmax function, $K$, $Q$ and $V$ are the Key, Query and Value matrices of the attention mechanism respectively. For symmetry $\\alpha_{kl}$ is also computed, and the two may be summed up to create an attention vector that maps the synergy between the two modalities $(k,l)$ involved.  Essentially, the difference between $\\alpha_{kl}$ and $\\alpha_{lk}$ is that in the former $modality_k$ is used as the query while in the latter $modality_l$ is used instead, and $modality_k$ takes the role of key and value.In the case of three or more modalities, multiple cross-attention mechanisms may be used so that every different combination is calculated. For example, if we have vision (V), text (T), and audio (A) modalities, then we create the combinations VT, VA, TA, and AVT in order to capture all possible cross-modal interactions.Even after using an attention mechanism, a concatenation of the above cross-modal vectors is often performed to produce the fused vector F. Sum(.), max(.) even pooling operations may also be used instead.ClassificationFinally, once the fusion has been completed, vector F is fed into a classification model. This is usually a neural network with one or two hidden layers. The input vector F encodes complementary information from multiple modalities, thus providing a richer representation compared to the individual modalities V, A, and T. Hence, it should increase the predictive power of the classifier. Mathematically, the aim of a unimodal model is to minimize the loss$$L(C(\\phi_m(X)),y)$$‍where $\\phi_m$ is an encoding function, typically a deep neural network, and C(.) is a classifier, typically one or more dense layers.In contrast, the aim of multimodal learning is to minimize the loss $$L_{multi}(C(\\phi_{m_1} \\oplus \\phi_{m_2} \\oplus  \\cdot  \\cdot  \\cdot \\oplus_{m_k},y)$$where $ \\oplus $ denotes a fusion operation (e.g., concatenation) and $\\phi_{mi}$ denotes encoding function of a single modality.5 Multimodal Deep Learning applicationsHere are some examples of Multimodal Deep Learning applications within the computer vision field:Image captioningImage captioning is the task of generating short text descriptions for a given image. It’s a multimodal task that involves multimodal datasets consisting of images and short text descriptions. It solves the translation challenge described previously by translating visual representations into textual ones. The task can also be extended to video captioning, where text coherently describes short videos.For a model to translate visual modalities into text, it has to capture the semantics of a picture. It needs to detect the key objects, key actions, and key characteristics of objects. Referencing the example of fig. 3,  “A horse (key object) carrying (key action) a large load (key characteristic) of hay (key object) and two people (key object) sitting on it.” Moreover, it needs to reason about the relationship between objects in an image, e.g., “Bunk bed with a narrow shelf sitting underneath it (spatial relationship).” However, as already mentioned, the task of multimodal translation is open-ended and subjective. Hence the caption “Two men are riding a horse carriage full of hay,” and “Two men transfer hay with a horse carriage,” are also valid captions.Image captioning models can be applied to provide text alternatives to images, which help blind and visually-impaired users.Examples of image captioning, images on top with short text explanations below (source)Pro Tip: Check out V7 Go for image captioning tasks. Image retrievalImage retrieval is the task of finding images inside a large database relevant to a retrieval key. The task is also sometimes referenced as Content-based image research (CBIR) and content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR). Such an action may be performed through a traditional tag-matching algorithm, but deep learning multimodal models provide a broader solution with more capabilities which also partially eliminates the need for tags. Image retrieval can be extended to video retrieval. Moreover, the retrieval key may take the form of a text caption, an audio sound even another image, but text descriptions are the most common.Several cross-modal image retrieval tasks have been developed. Examples includeText-to-image retrieval: images related to text explanations are retrievedComposing text and image: a query image and a text that describes desired modifications Cross-view image retrieval  Sketch-to-image retrieval: a human-made pencil sketch is used to retrieve relevant imagesWhenever you make a search query on your browser, the search engine provides an “images” section showing a plethora of images related to your search query. This is a real-world example of image retrieval.An example of multimodal image retrieval, using composing text + image method. The fetched images are fetched through a database if they meet the criteria of the query image and the text’s description (source)Text-to-Image GenerationText-to-image generation is currently one of the most popular multimodal learning applications. It directly solves the translation challenge. Models like Open-AI’s DALL-E and Google’s Imagen have been making headlines. What these models do can be considered the inverse of image captioning. Given short text descriptions as a prompt, a text-to-image model creates a novel image that accurately reflects the text’s semantic meaning. Recently, text-to-video models also made their first debut.These models can be applied to aid photoshopping and graphics design while also providing inspiration for digital art.Example of text-to-image generation. The text on the bottom acts as a prompt, and the model creates the novel image depicted on top (source)Visual Question Answering (VQA)Visual Question Answering is another multimodal task that combines visual modalities (image, video) with text modality. During VQA, the user can ask a question about an image or a video, and the model must answer the question based on what is happening in the image. A strong visual understanding of a scene, along with common sense knowledge, is required to successfully tackle this problem. Simple examples of closed-form VQA include “How many people are in the picture”, and “Where is the child sitting?” However, VQA can expand to free-form, open-ended questions which require a more complex thought process, like the image below.Visual question answering is a multimodal application that incorporates both translation and alignment challenges. These models can be applied to help blind and visually-impaired users or provide advanced visual content retrieval.Examples of open-ended, free-form questions for VQA tasks. Answering requires a complex thought process, precise decoding, and linking of both modalities involved (source)Emotion Recognition Emotion recognition is a great example of why multimodal datasets are preferred over monomodal ones. Emotion recognition can be performed with just monomodal datasets, but performance may be improved if multimodal datasets are used as input. The multimodal input may take the form of video + text + audio, but sensor data like encephalogram data may also be incorporated in the multimodal input.However, it has been shown that sometimes using multiple input modalities may actually degrade performance compared to single modality counterparts, even though a dataset with multiple modalities will always convey more information. This is attributed to the difficulty of training multimodal networks. If you are interested in learning more about the difficulties, this paper should prove useful.Multimodal Deep Learning DatasetsWithout data, there is no learning.Multimodal machine learning is no exception to this. To advance the field, researchers and organizations have created and distributed multiple multimodal datasets. Here’s a comprehensive list of the most popular datasets:COCO-Captions Dataset: A multimodal dataset that contains 330K images accompanied by short text descriptions. This dataset was released by Microsoft and aims to advance the research in image captioning.VQA: A Visual Question Answering multimodal dataset that contains 265K images (vision) with at least three questions (text) for each image. These questions require an understanding of vision, language, and commonsense knowledge to answer. Suitable for visual-question answering and image captioning.CMU-MOSEI: Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (MOSEI) is a multimodal dataset for human emotion recognition and sentiment analysis. It contains 23,500 sentences pronounced by 1,000 YouTube speakers. This dataset combines video, audio, and text modalities all in one. A perfect dataset for training models on the three most popular data modalities.Social-IQ: A perfect multimodal dataset to train deep learning models on visual reasoning, multimodal question answering, and social interaction understanding. Contains 1250 audio videos rigorously annotated (on the action level) with questions and answers (text) related to the actions taking place in each scene.Kinetics 400/600/700: This audiovisual dataset is a collection of Youtube videos for human action recognition. It contains video (visual modality) and sound (audio modality) of people performing various actions such as playing music, hugging, playing sports, etc. The dataset is suitable for action recognition, human pose estimation, or scene understanding.RGB-D Object Dataset: A multimodal dataset that combines visual and sensor modalities. One sensor is RGB and encodes colors in a picture, while the other is a depth sensor that encodes the distance of an object from the camera. This dataset contains videos of 300 household objects and 22 scenes, equal to 250K images. It has been used for 3D object detection, or depth estimation tasks.Other multimodal datasets include IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSI, MPI-SINTEL, SCENE-FLOW, HOW2, COIN, and MOUD.Pro tip: If you’re looking for quality training data for your next computer vision project, explore our repository of 500+ open datasets.Key takeawaysMultimodal deep learning is a step toward more powerful AI models.Datasets with multiple modalities convey more information than unimodal datasets, so machine learning models should, in theory, improve their predictive performance by processing multiple input modalities. However, the challenges and difficulties of training multimodal networks often pose a barrier to improving performance.Nonetheless, multimodal applications open a new world of possibilities for AI. Some tasks which humans may be very good at performing are only possible when models incorporate multiple modalities into their training.

      "Multimodal learning is a type of deep learning that integrates and processes multiple types of data, referred to as  modalities, such as text, audio, images, or video. This integration allows for a more holistic understanding of complex data, improving model performance in tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval,[1] text-to-image generation,[2] aesthetic ranking,[3] and image captioning.[4]\n",
      "Large multimodal models, such as Google Gemini and GPT-4o, have become increasingly popular since 2023, enabling increased versatility and a broader understanding of real-world phenomena.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivation[edit]\n",
      "Data usually comes with different modalities which carry different information. For example, it is very common to caption an image to convey the information not presented in the image itself. Similarly, sometimes it is more straightforward to use an image to describe information which may not be obvious from text. As a result, if different words appear in similar images, then these words likely describe the same thing. Conversely, if a word is used to describe seemingly dissimilar images, then these images may represent the same object. Thus, in cases dealing with multi-modal data, it is important to use a model which is able to jointly represent the information such that the model can capture the combined information from different modalities.\n",

      "This section is an excerpt from Transformer (deep learning architecture) § Multimodality.[edit]\n",
      "Transformers can also be used/adapted for modalities (input or output) beyond just text, usually by finding a way to \"tokenize\" the modality.\n",
      "Multimodal models can either be trained from scratch, or by finetuning. A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning.[6] The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B)[7] and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.[8]\n",
      "Vision transformers[9] adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\n",
      "Conformer[10] and later Whisper[11] follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\n",
      "Perceivers[12][13] are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\n",
      "\n",
      "For image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022),[14] Phenaki (2023),[15] and Muse (2023).[16] Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image.[17] Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image.[18] Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted.[16] Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.[15]\n",

This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.[22]\n",
      "Flamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch.[23] Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control.[24] LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs,[25] and video inputs.[26]\n",

      "Multimodal deep Boltzmann machines[edit]\n",
      "A Boltzmann machine is a type of stochastic neural network invented by Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski in 1985. Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield nets. They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics. The units in Boltzmann machines are divided into two groups: visible units and hidden units. Each unit is like a neuron with a binary output that represents whether it is activated or not.[31] General Boltzmann machines allow connection between any units. However, learning is impractical using general Boltzmann Machines because the computational time is exponential to the size of the machine[citation needed]. A more efficient architecture is called restricted Boltzmann machine where connection is only allowed between hidden unit and visible unit, which is described in the next section.\n",
      "Multimodal deep Boltzmann machines can process and learn from different types of information, such as images and text, simultaneously. This can notably be done by having a separate deep Boltzmann machine for each modality, for example one for images and one for text, joined at an additional top hidden layer.[32]\n",

      "Activity recognition aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. Since the 1980s, this research field has captured the attention of several computer science communities due to its strength in providing personalized support for many different applications and its connection to many different fields of study such as medicine, human-computer interaction, or sociology.\n",
      "Due to its multifaceted nature, different fields may refer to activity recognition as plan recognition, goal recognition, intent recognition, behavior recognition, location estimation and location-based services.\n",

      "Sensor-based, single-user activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Sensor-based activity recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel data mining and machine learning techniques to model a wide range of human activities.[1][2] Mobile devices (e.g. smart phones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life. Sensor-based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering ubiquitous computers and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents (under consent), these computers will be better suited to act on our behalf. Visual sensors that incorporate color and depth information, such as the Kinect, allow more accurate automatic action recognition and fuse many emerging applications such as interactive education[3] and smart environments.[4] Multiple views of visual sensor enable the development of machine learning for automatic view invariant action recognition.[5] More advanced sensors used in 3D motion capture systems allow highly accurate automatic recognition, in the expenses of more complicated hardware system setup.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Levels of sensor-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Sensor-based activity recognition is a challenging task due to the inherent noisy nature of the input. Thus, statistical modeling has been the main thrust in this direction in layers, where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected. At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data. At an intermediate level, statistical inference may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels. Furthermore, at the highest level, a major concern is to find out the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensor-based, multi-user activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Recognizing activities for multiple users using on-body sensors first appeared in the work by ORL using active badge systems[7] in the early 1990s. Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios.[8] Activities of Multiple Users in intelligent environments are addressed in Gu et al.[9] In this work, they investigate the fundamental problem of recognizing activities for multiple users from sensor readings in a home environment, and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize both single-user and multi-user activities in a unified solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensor-based group activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Recognition of group activities is fundamentally different from single, or multi-user activity recognition in that the goal is to recognize the behavior of the group as an entity, rather than the activities of the individual members within it.[10]  Group behavior is emergent in nature, meaning that the properties of the behavior of the group are fundamentally different than the properties of the behavior of the individuals within it, or any sum of that behavior.[11]  The main challenges are in modeling the behavior of the individual group members, as well as the roles of the individual within the group dynamic[12] and their relationship to emergent behavior of the group in parallel.[13]  Challenges which must still be addressed include quantification of the behavior and roles of individuals who join the group, integration of explicit models for role description into inference algorithms, and scalability evaluations for very large groups and crowds.  Group activity recognition has applications for crowd management and response in emergency situations, as well as for social networking and Quantified Self applications.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaches[edit]\n",
      "Activity recognition through logic and reasoning[edit]\n",
      "Logic-based approaches keep track of all logically consistent explanations of the observed actions. Thus, all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered. Kautz provided a formal theory of plan recognition. He described plan recognition as a logical inference process of circumscription. All actions and plans are uniformly referred to as goals, and a recognizer's knowledge is represented by a set of first-order statements, called event hierarchy.  Event hierarchy is encoded in first-order logic, which defines abstraction, decomposition and functional relationships between types of events.[15]\n",
      "Kautz's general framework for plan recognition has an exponential time complexity in worst case, measured in the size of the input hierarchy. Lesh and Etzioni went one step further and presented methods in scaling up goal recognition to scale up his work computationally. In contrast to Kautz's approach where the plan library is explicitly represented, Lesh and Etzioni's approach enables automatic plan-library construction from domain primitives. Furthermore, they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries.[16]\n",
      "Inconsistent plans and goals are repeatedly pruned when new actions arrive. Besides, they also presented methods for adapting a goal recognizer to handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given a sample of an individual's recent behavior. Pollack et al. described a direct argumentation model that can know about the relative strength of several kinds of arguments for belief and intention description.\n",
      "A serious problem of logic-based approaches is their inability or inherent infeasibility to represent uncertainty. They offer no mechanism for preferring one consistent approach to another and are incapable of deciding whether one particular plan is more likely than another, as long as both of them can be consistent enough to explain the actions observed. There is also a lack of learning ability associated with logic based methods.\n",
      "Another approach to logic-based activity recognition is to use stream reasoning based on answer set programming,[17] and has been applied to recognising activities for health-related applications,[18]  which uses weak constraints to model a degree of ambiguity/uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning[edit]\n",
      "Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions, plans and goals under uncertainty.[19] In the literature, there have been several approaches which explicitly represent uncertainty in reasoning about an agent's plans and goals.\n",
      "Using sensor data as input, Hodges and Pollack designed machine learning-based systems for identifying individuals as they perform routine daily activities such as making coffee.[20] Intel Research (Seattle) Lab and University of Washington at Seattle have done some important works on using sensors to detect human plans.[21][22][23] Some of these works infer user transportation modes from readings of radio-frequency identifiers (RFID) and global positioning systems (GPS).\n",
      "The use of temporal probabilistic models has been shown to perform well in activity recognition and generally outperform non-temporal models.[24] Generative models such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the more generally formulated Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) are popular choices in modelling activities from sensor data.[25][26][27][28]\n",
      "Discriminative models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are also commonly applied and also give good performance in activity recognition.[29][30]\n",
      "Generative and discriminative models both have their pros and cons and the ideal choice depends on their area of application. A dataset together with implementations of a number of popular models (HMM, CRF) for activity recognition can be found here.\n",
      "Conventional temporal probabilistic models such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model the correlations between the activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data.[26][31][32] The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing a stir fry, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs)[31] and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining based approach to activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Different from traditional machine learning approaches, an approach based on data mining has been recently proposed. In the work of Gu et al., the problem of activity recognition is formulated as a pattern-based classification problem. They proposed a data mining approach based on discriminative patterns which describe significant changes between any two activity classes of data to recognize sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities in a unified solution.[33] Gilbert et al. use 2D corners in both space and time. These are grouped spatially and temporally using a hierarchical process, with an increasing search area. At each stage of the hierarchy, the most distinctive and descriptive features are learned efficiently through data mining (Apriori rule).[34]\n",
      "\n",
      "GPS-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "Location-based activity recognition can also rely on GPS data to recognize activities.[35][36]\n",

      "Vision-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "It is a very important and challenging problem to track and understand the behavior of agents through videos taken by various cameras. The primary technique employed is Computer Vision. Vision-based activity recognition has found many applications such as human-computer interaction, user interface design, robot learning, and surveillance, among others.\n",
      "Scientific conferences where vision based activity recognition work often appears are ICCV and CVPR.\n",
      "In vision-based activity recognition, a great deal of work has been done. Researchers have attempted a number of methods such as optical flow, Kalman filtering, Hidden Markov models, etc., under different modalities such as single camera, stereo, and infrared. In addition, researchers have considered multiple aspects on this topic, including single pedestrian tracking, group tracking, and detecting dropped objects.\n",
      "Recently some researchers have used RGBD cameras like Microsoft Kinect to detect human activities.[37] Depth cameras add extra dimension i.e. depth which normal 2d camera fails to provide. Sensory information from these depth cameras have been used to generate real-time skeleton model of humans with different body positions.[38] This skeleton information provides meaningful information that researchers have used to model human activities which are trained and later used to recognize unknown activities.[39][40]\n",
      "With the recent emergency of deep learning, RGB video based activity recognition has seen rapid development. It uses videos captured by RGB cameras as input and perform several tasks, including: video classification, detection of activity start and end in videos, and spatial-temporal localization of activity and the people performing the activity.[41] Pose estimation methods[42] allow extracting more representative skeletal features for action recognition.[43] That said, it has been discovered that deep learning based action recognition may suffer from adversarial attacks, where an attacker alter the input insignificantly to fool an action recognition system.[44]\n",
      "Despite remarkable progress of vision-based activity recognition, its usage for most actual visual surveillance applications remains a distant aspiration.[45] Conversely, the human brain seems to have perfected the ability to recognize human actions. This capability relies not only on acquired knowledge, but also on the aptitude of extracting information relevant to a given context and logical reasoning. Based on this observation, it has been proposed to enhance vision-based activity recognition systems by integrating commonsense reasoning and, contextual and commonsense knowledge.\n",
      "Hierarchical Human Activity (HAR) Recognition\n",
      "Hierarchical human activity recognition is a technique within computer vision and machine learning. It aims to identify and comprehend human actions or behaviors from visual data. This method entails structuring activities hierarchically, creating a framework that represents connections and interdependencies among various actions.[46] HAR techniques can be used to understand data correlations and model fundamentals to improve models, to balance accuracy and privacy concerns in sensitive application areas, and to identify and manage trivial labels that have no relevance in specific use cases.[47]\n",

      "Levels of vision-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "In vision-based activity recognition, the computational process is often divided into four steps, namely human detection, human tracking, human activity recognition and then a high-level activity evaluation.\n",

      "Fine-grained action localization[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Object co-segmentation\n",
      "In computer vision-based activity recognition, fine-grained action localization typically provides per-image segmentation masks delineating the human object and its action category (e.g., Segment-Tube[48]). Techniques such as dynamic Markov Networks, CNN and LSTM are often employed to exploit the semantic correlations between consecutive video frames. Geometric fine-grained features such as objective bounding boxes and human poses facilitate activity recognition with graph neural network.[41][49]\n",

      "Automatic gait recognition[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Gait recognition\n",
      "One way to identify specific people is by how they walk. Gait-recognition software can be used to record a person's gait or gait feature profile in a database for the purpose of recognizing that person later, even if they are wearing a disguise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wi-Fi-based activity recognition[edit]\n",
      "When activity recognition is performed indoors and in cities using the widely available Wi-Fi signals and 802.11 access points, there is much noise and uncertainty. These uncertainties can be modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network model.[50] In a multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals, a deterministic state transition model is applied.[51] Another possible method models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach.[52] A user action discovery model could segment Wi-Fi signals to produce possible actions.[53]\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic models of Wi-Fi recognition[edit]\n",
      "One of the primary thought of Wi-Fi activity recognition is that when the signal goes through the human body during transmission; which causes reflection, diffraction, and scattering. Researchers can get information from these signals to analyze the activity of the human body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Static transmission model[edit]\n",
      "As shown in,[54] when wireless signals are transmitted indoors, obstacles such as walls, the ground, and the human body cause various effects such as reflection, scattering, diffraction, and diffraction. Therefore, receiving end receives multiple signals from different paths at the same time, because surfaces reflect the signal during the transmission, which is known as multipath effect.\n",
      "The static model is based on these two kinds of signals: the direct signal and the reflected signal. Because there is no obstacle in the direct path, direct signal transmission can be modeled by Friis transmission equation:\n",

      "             min read—Dec 15, 2022Learn how multimodal deep learning works. See the challenges of using multimodal datasets, and how deep learning models process multimodal inputs.Konstantinos PoulinakisGuest AuthorHumans use five senses to experience and interpret the world around them. Our five senses capture information from five different sources, and five different modalities. A modality refers to the way in which something happens, is experienced, or captured. AI is on a quest to mimic the human brain.Human brains consist of neural networks that can process multiple modalities simultaneously. Imagine having a conversation—your brain’s neural networks process multimodal inputs (audio, vision, text, odors). After a deep subconscious modality fusion, you can reason about what your interlocutor is saying, their emotional state, and your/their surroundings. This allows for a more holistic view and deeper comprehension of the situation. For artificial intelligence to match human intelligence, it's imperative that it learns to interpret, reason, and fuse multimodal information. One of the latest and most promising trends in Deep Learning research is Multimodal Deep Learning. In this article, we demystify multimodal deep learning. We discuss multimodal fusion, multimodal datasets, multimodal applications, and explain how machine learning models that perceive the world more holistically are built.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Multimodal Deep LearningMultimodal Learning ChallengesHow Multimodal Learning worksFive Multimodal Deep Learning applicationsData extraction powered by AIAutomate data extractionGet started todayExplore V7 GoData extraction powered by AIAutomate data extractionGet started todayExplore V7 GoReady to streamline AI product deployment right away? Check out:V7 Model TrainingV7 WorkflowsV7 Auto AnnotationV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Multimodal Deep Learning Multimodal machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that learn and improve performance through the use of multimodal datasets. Multimodal Deep Learning is a machine learning subfield that aims to train AI models to process and find relationships between different types of data (modalities)—typically, images, video, audio, and text. By combining different modalities, a deep learning model can comprehend its environment more universally since some cues exist only in certain modalities. Imagine the task of emotion recognition. There is more to it than just looking at a human face (visual modality). The tone and pitch of a person’s voice (audio modality) encode enormous amounts of information about their emotional state, which might not be visible through their facial expressions, even if they are often in sync. Unimodal or Monomodal models, models that process only a single modality, have been researched to a great extent and have provided extraordinary results in advancing fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, unimodal deep learning has limited capabilities, so the need for multimodal models arises. The image below is an example of how unimodal models fail in some tasks, like recognizing sarcasm or hate speech. The figure is part of META’s multimodal dataset “Hateful Memes”.Combining image and text to create a sarcastic meme. Unimodal models are unable to perceive such kind of sarcasm since each individual modality contains just half the information. In contrast, a multimodal model that processes both text and images can relate the two and discover the deeper meaning. (source)Multimodal models, more often than not, rely on deep neural networks even though other machine learning models, such as hidden Markov models HMM or Restricted Boltzman Machines RBM have been incorporated in earlier research. In multimodal deep learning, the most typical modalities are visual (images, videos), textual, and auditory (voice, sounds, music). However, other less typical modalities include 3D visual data, depth sensor data, and LiDAR data (typical in self-driving cars). In clinical practice, imaging modalities include computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, while non-image modalities include electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Sensor data like thermal data or data from eye-tracking devices can also be included in the list. Any combination of the above unimodal data results in a multimodal dataset. For example, combiningVideo + LiDAR+ depth data creates an excellent dataset for self-driving car applications. EEG  + eye tracking device data, creates a multimodal dataset that connects eye movements with brain activity. However, the most popular combinations are combinations of the three most popular modalitiesImage + Text Image + AudioImage + Text + AudioText + Audio Multimodal Learning ChallengesMultimodal deep learning aims to solve five core challenges that are active areas of research. Solutions or improvements on any of the below challenges will advance multimodal AI research and practice.RepresentationMultimodal representation is the task of encoding data from multiple modalities in the form of a vector or tensor. Good representations that capture semantic information of raw data are very important for the success of machine learning models. However, feature extraction from heterogeneous data in a way that exploits the synergies between them is very hard. Moreover, fully exploiting the complementarity of different modalities and not paying attention to redundant information is essential.  Multimodal representations fall into two categories. 1. Joint representation: each individual modality is encoded and then placed into a mutual high dimensional space. This is the most direct way and may work well when modalities are of similar nature.2. Coordinated representation: each individual modality is encoded irrespective of one another, but their representations are then coordinated by imposing a restriction. For example, their linear projections should be maximally correlated‍$$(u*,v*) = argmaxu,v(u^TX,v^TY)$$‍where X, Y denote input modalities, $(u^T, v^T)$ denote matrices that transfer input modalities to some representation space and $(u^*, v^*)$ denote the desired representation matrices that transfer inputs to a mutual representation space after the restriction has been imposed.FusionFusion is the task of joining information from two or more modalities to perform a prediction task. Effective fusion of multiple modalities, such as video, speech, and text, is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data. Fusing heterogeneous information is the core of multimodal research but comes with a big set of challenges. Practical challenges involve solving problems such as different formats, different lengths, and non-synchronized data. Theoretical challenges involve finding the most optimal fusion technique. Options include simple operations such as concatenation or weighted sum, and more sophisticated attention mechanisms such as transformer networks, or attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs).Finally, one may also need to choose between early or late fusion. In early fusion, features are integrated immediately after feature extraction with some of the above fusion mechanisms. On the other hand, during late fusion, integration is performed only after each unimodal network outputs a prediction (classification, regression). Voting schemes, weighted averages, and other techniques or usually used on late fusion. Hybrid fusion techniques have also been proposed. These combine outputs from early fusion and unimodal predictors. AlignmentAlignment refers to the task of identifying direct relationships between different modalities. Current research in multimodal learning aims to create modality-invariant representations. This means that when different modalities refer to a similar semantic concept, their representations must be similar/close together in a latent space. For example, the sentence “she dived into the pool”, an image of a pool, and the audio signal of a splash sound should lie close together in a manifold of the representation space.TranslationTranslating is the act of mapping one modality to another. The main idea is how one modality (e.g., textual modality) can be translated to another (e.g., visual modalities) while retaining the semantic meaning. Translations, however, are open-ended, subjective, and no perfect answer exists, which adds to the complexity of the task.Part of the current research in multimodal learning is to construct generative models that make translations between different modalities. The recent DALL-E and other text-to-image models are great examples of such generative models that translate text modalities to visual modalities.Read more: If you’re interested in the subject of using AI for creating works of art, read our article  AI-Generated Art: From Text to Images & BeyondCo-LearningMultimodal Co-learning aims to transfer information learned through one or more modalities to tasks involving another. Co-learning is especially important in cases of low-resource target tasks, fully/partly missing or noisy modalities. Translation—explained in the section above—may be used as a method of co-learning to transfer knowledge from one modality to another. Neuroscience suggests that humans may use methods of co-learning through translation, as well. People who suffer from aphantasia, the inability to create mental images in their heads, perform worse on memory tests. The opposite is also true, people who do create such mappings, textual/auditory to visual, perform better on memory tests. This suggests that being able to convert representations between different modalities is an important aspect of human cognition and memory.How does Multimodal Learning workMultimodal neural networks are usually a combination of multiple unimodal neural networks. For example, an audiovisual model might consist of two unimodal networks, one for visual data and one for audio data. These unimodal neural networks usually process their inputs separately. This process is called encoding. After unimodal encoding takes place, the information extracted from each model must be fused together. Multiple fusion techniques have been proposed that range from simple concatenation to attention mechanisms. The process of multimodal data fusion is one of the most important success factors. After fusion takes place, a final “decision” network accepts the fused encoded information and is trained on the end task.To put it simply, multimodal architectures usually consist of three parts:Unimodal encoders that encode individual modalities. Usually, one for each input modality.A fusion network that combines the features extracted from each input modality, during the encoding phase.A classifier that accepts the fused data and makes predictions.We refer to the above as the encoding module (DL Module in the image below), fusion module, and classification module. Workflow of a typical multimodal. Three unimodal neural networks encode the different input modalities independently. After feature extraction, fusion modules combine the different modalities (optionally in pairs), and finally, the fused features are inserted into a classification network.Let’s now dive a little deeper into each component.Encoding During encoding, we seek to create meaningful representations. Usually, each individual modality is handled by a different monomodal encoder. However, it’s often the case that the inputs are in the form of embeddings instead of their raw form. For example, word2vec embeddings may be used for text, and COVAREP embeddings for audio. Multimodal embeddings such as data2veq, which translate video, text, and audio data into embeddings in a high dimensional space, are one of the latest practices and have outperformed other embeddings achieving SOTA performance in many tasks.Deciding whether it's more suitable to use joint representations or coordinated representations (explained in the representation challenge) is an important decision. Usually, a joint representation method works well when modalities are similar in nature, and it’s the one most often used. In practice when designing multimodal networks, encoders are chosen based on what works well in each area since more emphasis is given to designing the fusion method. Many research papers use the all-time-classic ResNets for the visual modalities and RoBERTA for text. Read more: Learn more about supervised vs. unsupervised learning and see examples of each. FusionThe fusion module is responsible for combining each individual modality after feature extraction is completed. The method/architecture used for fusion is probably the most important ingredient for success.The simplest method is to use simple operations such as concatenating or summing the different unimodal representations. However, more sophisticated and successful methods have been researched and implemented. For example, the cross-attention layer mechanism is one of the more recent and successful fusion methods. It has been used to capture cross-modal interactions and fuse modalities in a more meaningful way. The equation below describes the cross-attention mechanism and assumes basic familiarity with self-attention.$$\\alpha_{kl} = s(\\frac{K_lQ_k}{\\sqrt{d}})V_l‍$$Where $\\alpha_{kl}$ denotes the attention score vector, $s(.)$ denotes the softmax function, $K$, $Q$ and $V$ are the Key, Query and Value matrices of the attention mechanism respectively. For symmetry $\\alpha_{kl}$ is also computed, and the two may be summed up to create an attention vector that maps the synergy between the two modalities $(k,l)$ involved.  Essentially, the difference between $\\alpha_{kl}$ and $\\alpha_{lk}$ is that in the former $modality_k$ is used as the query while in the latter $modality_l$ is used instead, and $modality_k$ takes the role of key and value.In the case of three or more modalities, multiple cross-attention mechanisms may be used so that every different combination is calculated. For example, if we have vision (V), text (T), and audio (A) modalities, then we create the combinations VT, VA, TA, and AVT in order to capture all possible cross-modal interactions.Even after using an attention mechanism, a concatenation of the above cross-modal vectors is often performed to produce the fused vector F. Sum(.), max(.) even pooling operations may also be used instead.ClassificationFinally, once the fusion has been completed, vector F is fed into a classification model. This is usually a neural network with one or two hidden layers. The input vector F encodes complementary information from multiple modalities, thus providing a richer representation compared to the individual modalities V, A, and T. Hence, it should increase the predictive power of the classifier. Mathematically, the aim of a unimodal model is to minimize the loss$$L(C(\\phi_m(X)),y)$$‍where $\\phi_m$ is an encoding function, typically a deep neural network, and C(.) is a classifier, typically one or more dense layers.In contrast, the aim of multimodal learning is to minimize the loss $$L_{multi}(C(\\phi_{m_1} \\oplus \\phi_{m_2} \\oplus  \\cdot  \\cdot  \\cdot \\oplus_{m_k},y)$$where $ \\oplus $ denotes a fusion operation (e.g., concatenation) and $\\phi_{mi}$ denotes encoding function of a single modality.5 Multimodal Deep Learning applicationsHere are some examples of Multimodal Deep Learning applications within the computer vision field:Image captioningImage captioning is the task of generating short text descriptions for a given image. It’s a multimodal task that involves multimodal datasets consisting of images and short text descriptions. It solves the translation challenge described previously by translating visual representations into textual ones. The task can also be extended to video captioning, where text coherently describes short videos.For a model to translate visual modalities into text, it has to capture the semantics of a picture. It needs to detect the key objects, key actions, and key characteristics of objects. Referencing the example of fig. 3,  “A horse (key object) carrying (key action) a large load (key characteristic) of hay (key object) and two people (key object) sitting on it.” Moreover, it needs to reason about the relationship between objects in an image, e.g., “Bunk bed with a narrow shelf sitting underneath it (spatial relationship).” However, as already mentioned, the task of multimodal translation is open-ended and subjective. Hence the caption “Two men are riding a horse carriage full of hay,” and “Two men transfer hay with a horse carriage,” are also valid captions.Image captioning models can be applied to provide text alternatives to images, which help blind and visually-impaired users.Examples of image captioning, images on top with short text explanations below (source)Pro Tip: Check out V7 Go for image captioning tasks. Image retrievalImage retrieval is the task of finding images inside a large database relevant to a retrieval key. The task is also sometimes referenced as Content-based image research (CBIR) and content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR). Such an action may be performed through a traditional tag-matching algorithm, but deep learning multimodal models provide a broader solution with more capabilities which also partially eliminates the need for tags. Image retrieval can be extended to video retrieval. Moreover, the retrieval key may take the form of a text caption, an audio sound even another image, but text descriptions are the most common.Several cross-modal image retrieval tasks have been developed. Examples includeText-to-image retrieval: images related to text explanations are retrievedComposing text and image: a query image and a text that describes desired modifications Cross-view image retrieval  Sketch-to-image retrieval: a human-made pencil sketch is used to retrieve relevant imagesWhenever you make a search query on your browser, the search engine provides an “images” section showing a plethora of images related to your search query. This is a real-world example of image retrieval.An example of multimodal image retrieval, using composing text + image method. The fetched images are fetched through a database if they meet the criteria of the query image and the text’s description (source)Text-to-Image GenerationText-to-image generation is currently one of the most popular multimodal learning applications. It directly solves the translation challenge. Models like Open-AI’s DALL-E and Google’s Imagen have been making headlines. What these models do can be considered the inverse of image captioning. Given short text descriptions as a prompt, a text-to-image model creates a novel image that accurately reflects the text’s semantic meaning. Recently, text-to-video models also made their first debut.These models can be applied to aid photoshopping and graphics design while also providing inspiration for digital art.Example of text-to-image generation. The text on the bottom acts as a prompt, and the model creates the novel image depicted on top (source)Visual Question Answering (VQA)Visual Question Answering is another multimodal task that combines visual modalities (image, video) with text modality. During VQA, the user can ask a question about an image or a video, and the model must answer the question based on what is happening in the image. A strong visual understanding of a scene, along with common sense knowledge, is required to successfully tackle this problem. Simple examples of closed-form VQA include “How many people are in the picture”, and “Where is the child sitting?” However, VQA can expand to free-form, open-ended questions which require a more complex thought process, like the image below.Visual question answering is a multimodal application that incorporates both translation and alignment challenges. These models can be applied to help blind and visually-impaired users or provide advanced visual content retrieval.Examples of open-ended, free-form questions for VQA tasks. Answering requires a complex thought process, precise decoding, and linking of both modalities involved (source)Emotion Recognition Emotion recognition is a great example of why multimodal datasets are preferred over monomodal ones. Emotion recognition can be performed with just monomodal datasets, but performance may be improved if multimodal datasets are used as input. The multimodal input may take the form of video + text + audio, but sensor data like encephalogram data may also be incorporated in the multimodal input.However, it has been shown that sometimes using multiple input modalities may actually degrade performance compared to single modality counterparts, even though a dataset with multiple modalities will always convey more information. This is attributed to the difficulty of training multimodal networks. If you are interested in learning more about the difficulties, this paper should prove useful.Multimodal Deep Learning DatasetsWithout data, there is no learning.Multimodal machine learning is no exception to this. To advance the field, researchers and organizations have created and distributed multiple multimodal datasets. Here’s a comprehensive list of the most popular datasets:COCO-Captions Dataset: A multimodal dataset that contains 330K images accompanied by short text descriptions. This dataset was released by Microsoft and aims to advance the research in image captioning.VQA: A Visual Question Answering multimodal dataset that contains 265K images (vision) with at least three questions (text) for each image. These questions require an understanding of vision, language, and commonsense knowledge to answer. Suitable for visual-question answering and image captioning.CMU-MOSEI: Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (MOSEI) is a multimodal dataset for human emotion recognition and sentiment analysis. It contains 23,500 sentences pronounced by 1,000 YouTube speakers. This dataset combines video, audio, and text modalities all in one. A perfect dataset for training models on the three most popular data modalities.Social-IQ: A perfect multimodal dataset to train deep learning models on visual reasoning, multimodal question answering, and social interaction understanding. Contains 1250 audio videos rigorously annotated (on the action level) with questions and answers (text) related to the actions taking place in each scene.Kinetics 400/600/700: This audiovisual dataset is a collection of Youtube videos for human action recognition. It contains video (visual modality) and sound (audio modality) of people performing various actions such as playing music, hugging, playing sports, etc. The dataset is suitable for action recognition, human pose estimation, or scene understanding.RGB-D Object Dataset: A multimodal dataset that combines visual and sensor modalities. One sensor is RGB and encodes colors in a picture, while the other is a depth sensor that encodes the distance of an object from the camera. This dataset contains videos of 300 household objects and 22 scenes, equal to 250K images. It has been used for 3D object detection, or depth estimation tasks.Other multimodal datasets include IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSI, MPI-SINTEL, SCENE-FLOW, HOW2, COIN, and MOUD.Pro tip: If you’re looking for quality training data for your next computer vision project, explore our repository of 500+ open datasets.Key takeawaysMultimodal deep learning is a step toward more powerful AI models.Datasets with multiple modalities convey more information than unimodal datasets, so machine learning models should, in theory, improve their predictive performance by processing multiple input modalities. However, the challenges and difficulties of training multimodal networks often pose a barrier to improving performance.Nonetheless, multimodal applications open a new world of possibilities for AI. Some tasks which humans may be very good at performing are only possible when models incorporate multiple modalities into their training.

Just as we use sight, sound, and touch to interpret the world, these datasets combine various data formats—text, images, audio, and video—to offer a richer understanding of content.Think of it this way: if you tried to understand a movie just by reading the script, you'd miss out on the visual and auditory elements that make the story come alive. Multimodal datasets provide those missing pieces, allowing AI to catch subtleties and context that would be lost if it were limited to a single type of data. Another example is analyzing medical images alongside patient records. This approach can reveal patterns that might be missed if each type of data were examined separately, leading to breakthroughs in diagnosing diseases. It's like assembling multiple puzzle pieces to create a clearer, more comprehensive picture.In this blog, we've gathered the best multimodal datasets with links to these data sources. These datasets are crucial for Multimodal Deep Learning, which requires integrating multiple data sources to enhance performance in tasks such as image captioning, sentiment analysis, medical diagnostics, video analysis, speech recognition, emotion recognition, autonomous vehicles, and cross-modal retrieval.What is Multimodal Deep Learning?Multimodal deep learning, a subfield of Machine Learning, involves using deep learning techniques to analyze and integrate data from multiple data sources and modalities such as text, images, audio, and video simultaneously. This approach uses the complementary information from different types of data to improve model performance, enabling tasks like enhanced image captioning, audio-visual speech recognition, and cross-modal retrieval.Next-GPT: A Multimodal LLMBenefits of Multimodal Datasets in Computer VisionMultimodal datasets significantly enhance computer vision applications by providing richer and more contextual information. Here's how:   By combining visual data with other modalities and data sources like text, audio, or depth information, models can achieve higher accuracy in tasks such as object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.   Multimodal models are less susceptible to noise or variations in a single modality. For instance, combining visual and textual data can help in overcoming challenges like occlusions or ambiguous image content.Multimodal datasets allow models to learn deeper semantic relationships between objects and their context. This enables more sophisticated tasks like visual question answering (VQA) and image generation.   Multimodal dataset opens up possibilities for novel applications in computer vision, large language models, augmented reality, robotics, text-to-image generation, VQA, NLP and medical image analysis.By integrating information from data sources of different modalities, models can better understand the context of visual data, leading to more intelligent and human-like large language models.Top 10 Multimodal DatasetsFlickr30K Entities DatasetThe Flickr30K Entities dataset is an extension of the popular Flickr30K dataset, specifically designed to improve research in automatic image description and understand how language refers to objects in images. It provides more detailed annotations for image-text understanding tasks. Flickr30K Entities dataset built upon the Flickr30k dataset, which contains 31K+ images collected from Flickr. Each image in Flickr30k Entities is associated with five crowd-sourced captions describing the image content. The dataset adds bounding box annotations for all entities (people, objects, etc.) mentioned in the image captions. Flickr30K allows to develop better large language models with vision capabilities for image captioning, where the model can not only describe the image content but also pinpoint the location of the entities being described. It also allows the development of an improved grounded language understanding, which refers to a machine's ability to understand language in relation to the physical world.Research Paper: Flickr30k Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence ModelsAuthors: Bryan A.

The text reviews are presented as spoken language, captured in the video recordings, audio consists of vocal qualities (like tone, pitch, and emphasis) to reveal emotional aspects of the review beyond just the spoken words, and video consists of facial expressions, gestures, and overall body language provide additional cues to the reviewer's sentiment.MuSe-CaR aims to advance research in multimodal sentiment analysis by providing a rich dataset for training and evaluating models capable of understanding complex human emotions and opinions expressed through various modalities.Research Paper: The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Car Reviews (MuSe-CaR) Dataset: Collection, Insights and ImprovementsAuthors: Lukas Stappen, Alice Baird, Lea Schumann, Björn SchullerDataset Size: 40 hours of user-generated video material with more than 350 reviews and 70 host speakers (as well as 20 overdubbed narrators) from YouTube.Licence: End User Licence Agreement (EULA)Access Links: Muse Challenge WebsiteCLEVRCLEVR, which stands for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning, is a multimodal dataset designed to evaluate a machine learning model's ability to reason about the physical world using both visual information and natural language. It is a synthetic multimodal dataset created to test AI systems' ability to perform complex reasoning about visual scenes. CLEVR combines two modalities, visual and textual. Visual modality comprises rendered 3D scenes containing various objects. Each scene features a simple background and a set of objects with distinct properties like shape (cube, sphere, cylinder), size (large, small), color (gray, red, blue, etc.), and material (rubber, metal).  Textual modality consists of questions posed in natural language about the scene. These questions challenge models to not only \"see\" the objects but also understand their relationships and properties to answer accurately.CLEVR is used in applications like visual reasoning in robotics and other domains to understand the spatial relationships between objects in real-time (e.g., \"Which object is in front of the blue rubber cube?\"), counting and comparison to enumerate objects with specific properties (e.g., \"How many small spheres are there?\"), and  logical reasoning to understand the scene and the question to arrive at the correct answer, even if the answer isn't directly visible (e.g., \"The rubber object is entirely behind a cube. What color is it?\").Research Paper: CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual ReasoningAuthors: Justin Johnson, Bharath Hariharan, Laurens van der Maaten, Fei-Fei Li, Larry Zitnick, Ross GirshickDataset Size: 100,000  images, 864986 questions, 849,980 answers, 85,000 scene graph annotations and functional program representations.Licence: Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 licence.Access Links: Stanford University CLEVR PageInternVid InternVid is a relatively new multimodal dataset specifically designed for tasks related to video understanding and generation using generative models.

      "Multimodal learning is a type of deep learning that integrates and processes multiple types of data, referred to as  modalities, such as text, audio, images, or video. This integration allows for a more holistic understanding of complex data, improving model performance in tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval,[1] text-to-image generation,[2] aesthetic ranking,[3] and image captioning.[4]\n",
      "Large multimodal models, such as Google Gemini and GPT-4o, have become increasingly popular since 2023, enabling increased versatility and a broader understanding of real-world phenomena.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivation[edit]\n",
      "Data usually comes with different modalities which carry different information. For example, it is very common to caption an image to convey the information not presented in the image itself. Similarly, sometimes it is more straightforward to use an image to describe information which may not be obvious from text. As a result, if different words appear in similar images, then these words likely describe the same thing. Conversely, if a word is used to describe seemingly dissimilar images, then these images may represent the same object. Thus, in cases dealing with multi-modal data, it is important to use a model which is able to jointly represent the information such that the model can capture the combined information from different modalities.\n",

      "Transformers can also be used/adapted for modalities (input or output) beyond just text, usually by finding a way to \"tokenize\" the modality.\n",
      "Multimodal models can either be trained from scratch, or by finetuning. A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning.[6] The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B)[7] and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.[8]\n",

      "Conformer[10] and later Whisper[11] follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\n",

      "For image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022),[14] Phenaki (2023),[15] and Muse (2023).[16] Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image.[17] Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image.[18] Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted.[16] Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.[15]\n",

This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.[22]\n",
      "Flamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch.[23] Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control.[24] LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs,[25] and video inputs.[26]\n",

      "Multimodal deep Boltzmann machines[edit]\n",
      "A Boltzmann machine is a type of stochastic neural network invented by Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski in 1985. Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield nets. They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics. The units in Boltzmann machines are divided into two groups: visible units and hidden units. Each unit is like a neuron with a binary output that represents whether it is activated or not.[31] General Boltzmann machines allow connection between any units. However, learning is impractical using general Boltzmann Machines because the computational time is exponential to the size of the machine[citation needed]. A more efficient architecture is called restricted Boltzmann machine where connection is only allowed between hidden unit and visible unit, which is described in the next section.\n",
      "Multimodal deep Boltzmann machines can process and learn from different types of information, such as images and text, simultaneously. This can notably be done by having a separate deep Boltzmann machine for each modality, for example one for images and one for text, joined at an additional top hidden layer.[32]\n",

      "NumPy (pronounced /ˈnʌmpaɪ/ NUM-py) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.[3] The predecessor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors. NumPy is fiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS.[4]\n",

In 1995 the special interest group (SIG) matrix-sig was founded with the aim of defining an array computing package; among its members was Python designer and maintainer Guido van Rossum, who extended Python's syntax (in particular the indexing syntax[5]) to make array computing easier.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Numeric[edit]\n",
      "An implementation of a matrix package was completed by Jim Fulton, then generalized[further explanation needed] by Jim Hugunin and called Numeric[6] (also variously known as the \"Numerical Python extensions\" or \"NumPy\"), with influences from the APL family of languages, Basis, MATLAB, FORTRAN, S and S+, and others.[7][8]\n",
      "Hugunin, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[8]: 10  joined the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in 1997 to work on JPython,[6] leaving Paul Dubois of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to take over as maintainer.[8]: 10  Other early contributors include David Ascher, Konrad Hinsen and Travis Oliphant.[8]: 10 \n",
      "\n",
      "Numarray[edit]\n",
      "A new package called Numarray was written as a more flexible replacement for Numeric.[9] Like Numeric, it too is now deprecated.[10][11] Numarray had faster operations for large arrays, but was slower than Numeric on small ones,[12] so for a time both packages were used in parallel for different use cases. The last version of Numeric (v24.2) was released on 11 November 2005, while the last version of numarray (v1.5.2) was released on 24 August 2006.[13]\n",
      "There was a desire to get Numeric into the Python standard library, but Guido van Rossum decided that the code was not maintainable in its state then.[when?][14]\n",
      "\n",
      "NumPy[edit]\n",
      "In early 2005, NumPy developer Travis Oliphant wanted to unify the community around a single array package and ported Numarray's features to Numeric, releasing the result as NumPy 1.0 in 2006.[9] This new project was part of SciPy. To avoid installing the large SciPy package just to get an array object, this new package was separated and called NumPy. Support for Python 3 was added in 2011 with NumPy version 1.5.0.[15]\n",
      "In 2011, PyPy started development on an implementation of the NumPy API for PyPy.[16] As of 2023, it is not yet fully compatible with NumPy.[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "Features[edit]\n",
      "NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python, which is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter. Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than compiled equivalents due to the absence of compiler optimization. NumPy addresses the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays; using these requires rewriting some code, mostly inner loops, using NumPy.\n",
      "Using NumPy in Python gives functionality comparable to MATLAB since they are both interpreted,[18] and they both allow the user to write fast programs as long as most operations work on arrays or matrices instead of scalars. In comparison, MATLAB boasts a large number of additional toolboxes, notably Simulink, whereas NumPy is intrinsically integrated with Python, a more modern and complete programming language. Moreover, complementary Python packages are available; SciPy is a library that adds more MATLAB-like functionality and Matplotlib is a plotting package that provides MATLAB-like plotting functionality. Although matlab can perform sparse matrix operations, numpy alone cannot perform such operations and requires the use of the scipy.sparse library. Internally, both MATLAB and NumPy rely on BLAS and LAPACK for efficient linear algebra computations.\n",
      "Python bindings of the widely used computer vision library OpenCV utilize NumPy arrays to store and operate on data.\n",
      "Since images with multiple channels are simply represented as three-dimensional arrays, indexing, slicing or masking with other arrays are very efficient ways to access specific pixels of an image.\n",
      "The NumPy array as universal data structure in OpenCV for images, extracted feature points, filter kernels and many more vastly simplifies the programming workflow and debugging.[citation needed]\n",
      "Importantly, many NumPy operations release the global interpreter lock, which allows for multithreaded processing.[19]\n",
      "NumPy also provides a C API, which allows Python code to interoperate with external libraries written in low-level languages.[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "The ndarray data structure[edit]\n",
      "The core functionality of NumPy is its \"ndarray\", for n-dimensional array, data structure. These arrays are strided views on memory.[9] In contrast to Python's built-in list data structure, these arrays are homogeneously typed: all elements of a single array must be of the same type.\n",
      "Such arrays can also be views into memory buffers allocated by C/C++, Python, and Fortran extensions to the CPython interpreter without the need to copy data around, giving a degree of compatibility with existing numerical libraries. This functionality is exploited by the SciPy package, which wraps a number of such libraries (notably BLAS and LAPACK). NumPy has built-in support for memory-mapped ndarrays.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations[edit]\n",
      "Inserting or appending entries to an array is not as trivially possible as it is with Python's lists.\n",
      "The np.pad(...) routine to extend arrays actually creates new arrays of the desired shape and padding values, copies the given array into the new one and returns it.\n",
      "NumPy's np.concatenate([a1,a2]) operation does not actually link the two arrays but returns a new one, filled with the entries from both given arrays in sequence.\n",
      "Reshaping the dimensionality of an array with np.reshape(...) is only possible as long as the number of elements in the array does not change.\n",
      "These circumstances originate from the fact that NumPy's arrays must be views on contiguous memory buffers.\n",
      "Algorithms that are not expressible as a vectorized operation will typically run slowly because they must be implemented in \"pure Python\", while vectorization may increase memory complexity of some operations from constant to linear, because temporary arrays must be created that are as large as the inputs. Runtime compilation of numerical code has been implemented by several groups to avoid these problems; open source solutions that interoperate with NumPy include numexpr[21] and Numba.[22] Cython and Pythran are static-compiling alternatives to these.\n",
      "Many modern large-scale scientific computing applications have requirements that exceed the capabilities of the NumPy arrays.\n",
      "For example, NumPy arrays are usually loaded into a computer's memory, which might have insufficient capacity for the analysis of large datasets.\n",
      "Further, NumPy operations are executed on a single CPU.\n",
      "However, many linear algebra operations can be accelerated by executing them on clusters of CPUs or of specialized hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, which many deep learning applications rely on.\n",
      "As a result, several alternative array implementations have arisen in the scientific python ecosystem over the recent years, such as Dask for distributed arrays and TensorFlow or JAX[23] for computations on GPUs.\n",
      "Because of its popularity, these often implement a subset of NumPy's API or mimic it, so that users can change their array implementation with minimal changes to their code required.[3] A library named CuPy,[24] accelerated by Nvidia's CUDA framework, has also shown potential for faster computing, being a 'drop-in replacement' of NumPy.[25]\n",

      "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.\n",
      "It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object,\n",
      "various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an\n",
      "assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including\n",
      "mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O,\n",
      "discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical\n",
      "operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
      "At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object.  This\n",
      "encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with\n",
      "many operations being performed in compiled code for performance.\n",
      "There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the\n",
      "standard Python sequences:\n",
      "\n",
      "NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists\n",
      "(which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will\n",
      "create a new array and delete the original.\n",
      "The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same\n",
      "data type, and thus will be the same size in memory.  The exception:\n",
      "one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby\n",
      "allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n",
      "NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of\n",
      "operations on large numbers of data.  Typically, such operations are\n",
      "executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using\n",
      "Python’s built-in sequences.\n",
      "A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based\n",
      "packages are using NumPy arrays; though these typically support\n",
      "Python-sequence input, they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior\n",
      "to processing, and they often output NumPy arrays.  In other words,\n",
      "in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s\n",
      "scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to\n",
      "use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient - one also\n",
      "needs to know how to use NumPy arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "The points about sequence size and speed are particularly important in\n",
      "scientific computing.  As a simple example, consider the case of\n",
      "multiplying each element in a 1-D sequence with the corresponding\n",
      "element in another sequence of the same length.  If the data are\n",
      "stored in two Python lists, a and b, we could iterate over\n",
      "each element:\n",
      "c = []\n",
      "for i in range(len(a)):\n",
      "    c.append(a[i]*b[i])\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This produces the correct answer, but if a and b each contain\n",
      "millions of numbers, we will pay the price for the inefficiencies of\n",
      "looping in Python.  We could accomplish the same task much more\n",
      "quickly in C by writing (for clarity we neglect variable declarations\n",
      "and initializations, memory allocation, etc.)\n",
      "for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {\n",
      "  c[i] = a[i]*b[i];\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This saves all the overhead involved in interpreting the Python code\n",
      "and manipulating Python objects, but at the expense of the benefits\n",
      "gained from coding in Python.  Furthermore, the coding work required\n",
      "increases with the dimensionality of our data. In the case of a 2-D\n",
      "array, for example, the C code (abridged as before) expands to\n",
      "for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {\n",
      "  for (j = 0; j < columns; j++) {\n",
      "    c[i][j] = a[i][j]*b[i][j];\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "NumPy gives us the best of both worlds: element-by-element operations\n",
      "are the “default mode” when an ndarray is involved, but the\n",

      "features which are the basis of much of its power: vectorization and\n",
      "broadcasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is NumPy fast?#\n",
      "Vectorization describes the absence of any explicit looping, indexing,\n",
      "etc., in the code - these things are taking place, of course, just\n",
      "“behind the scenes” in optimized, pre-compiled C code.  Vectorized\n",
      "code has many advantages, among which are:\n",
      "\n",
      "vectorized code is more concise and easier to read\n",
      "fewer lines of code generally means fewer bugs\n",
      "the code more closely resembles standard mathematical notation\n",
      "(making it easier, typically, to correctly code mathematical\n",
      "constructs)\n",
      "vectorization results in more “Pythonic” code. Without\n",
      "vectorization, our code would be littered with inefficient and\n",
      "difficult to read for loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Broadcasting is the term used to describe the implicit\n",
      "element-by-element behavior of operations; generally speaking, in\n",
      "NumPy all operations, not just arithmetic operations, but\n",
      "logical, bit-wise, functional, etc., behave in this implicit\n",
      "element-by-element fashion, i.e., they broadcast.  Moreover, in the\n",
      "example above, a and b could be multidimensional arrays of the\n",
      "same shape, or a scalar and an array, or even two arrays with\n",
      "different shapes, provided that the smaller array is “expandable” to\n",

      "If you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).\n",
      "\n",
      "PyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the\n",

      "We provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs\n",
      "such as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.\n",
      "And they are fast!\n",
      "Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd\n",
      "PyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.\n",
      "Most frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.\n",
      "One has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.\n",

      "Our goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.\n",
      "Imperative Experiences\n",
      "PyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.\n",
      "When you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.\n",
      "When you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.\n",
      "The stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.\n",
      "We hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.\n",
      "Fast and Lean\n",
      "PyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries\n",
      "such as Intel MKL and NVIDIA (cuDNN, NCCL) to maximize speed.\n",
      "At the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends\n",
      "are mature and have been tested for years.\n",
      "Hence, PyTorch is quite fast — whether you run small or large neural networks.\n",
      "The memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.\n",
      "We've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that\n",
      "your deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.\n",
      "This enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.\n",
      "Extensions Without Pain\n",
      "Writing new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward\n",

      "or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy.\n",

Just as we use sight, sound, and touch to interpret the world, these datasets combine various data formats—text, images, audio, and video—to offer a richer understanding of content.Think of it this way: if you tried to understand a movie just by reading the script, you'd miss out on the visual and auditory elements that make the story come alive. Multimodal datasets provide those missing pieces, allowing AI to catch subtleties and context that would be lost if it were limited to a single type of data. Another example is analyzing medical images alongside patient records. This approach can reveal patterns that might be missed if each type of data were examined separately, leading to breakthroughs in diagnosing diseases. It's like assembling multiple puzzle pieces to create a clearer, more comprehensive picture.In this blog, we've gathered the best multimodal datasets with links to these data sources. These datasets are crucial for Multimodal Deep Learning, which requires integrating multiple data sources to enhance performance in tasks such as image captioning, sentiment analysis, medical diagnostics, video analysis, speech recognition, emotion recognition, autonomous vehicles, and cross-modal retrieval.What is Multimodal Deep Learning?Multimodal deep learning, a subfield of Machine Learning, involves using deep learning techniques to analyze and integrate data from multiple data sources and modalities such as text, images, audio, and video simultaneously. This approach uses the complementary information from different types of data to improve model performance, enabling tasks like enhanced image captioning, audio-visual speech recognition, and cross-modal retrieval.Next-GPT: A Multimodal LLMBenefits of Multimodal Datasets in Computer VisionMultimodal datasets significantly enhance computer vision applications by providing richer and more contextual information. Here's how:   By combining visual data with other modalities and data sources like text, audio, or depth information, models can achieve higher accuracy in tasks such as object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.   Multimodal models are less susceptible to noise or variations in a single modality. For instance, combining visual and textual data can help in overcoming challenges like occlusions or ambiguous image content.Multimodal datasets allow models to learn deeper semantic relationships between objects and their context. This enables more sophisticated tasks like visual question answering (VQA) and image generation.   Multimodal dataset opens up possibilities for novel applications in computer vision, large language models, augmented reality, robotics, text-to-image generation, VQA, NLP and medical image analysis.By integrating information from data sources of different modalities, models can better understand the context of visual data, leading to more intelligent and human-like large language models.Top 10 Multimodal DatasetsFlickr30K Entities DatasetThe Flickr30K Entities dataset is an extension of the popular Flickr30K dataset, specifically designed to improve research in automatic image description and understand how language refers to objects in images. It provides more detailed annotations for image-text understanding tasks. Flickr30K Entities dataset built upon the Flickr30k dataset, which contains 31K+ images collected from Flickr. Each image in Flickr30k Entities is associated with five crowd-sourced captions describing the image content. The dataset adds bounding box annotations for all entities (people, objects, etc.) mentioned in the image captions. Flickr30K allows to develop better large language models with vision capabilities for image captioning, where the model can not only describe the image content but also pinpoint the location of the entities being described. It also allows the development of an improved grounded language understanding, which refers to a machine's ability to understand language in relation to the physical world.Research Paper: Flickr30k Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence ModelsAuthors: Bryan A. Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M. Cervantes, Juan C. Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana LazebnikDataset Size: 31,783 real-world images, 158,915 captions (5 per image), approximately 275,000 bounding boxes, 44,518 unique entity instances.Licence: The dataset typically follows the original Flickr30k dataset licence, which allows for research and academic use on non-commercial projects. However, you should verify the current licensing terms as they may have changed.Access Links: Bryan A. Plummer WebsiteVisual GenomeThe Visual Genome dataset is a multimodal dataset, bridging the gap between image content and textual descriptions. It offers a rich resource for researchers working in areas like image understanding, VQA, and multimodal learning. Visual Genome combines two modalities, first is Visual, containing over 108,000 images from the MSCOCO dataset are used as the visual component, and second is Textual, where images are extensively annotated with textual information (i.e. objects, relationships, region captions, question-answer pairs).The multimodal nature of this dataset offers advantages like deeper image understanding to allow identify meaning and relationships between objects in a scene beyond simple object detection, VQA to understand the context and answer questions that require reasoning about the visual content, and multimodal learning that can learn from both visual and textual data.Research Paper: Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image AnnotationsAuthors: Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A.

The text reviews are presented as spoken language, captured in the video recordings, audio consists of vocal qualities (like tone, pitch, and emphasis) to reveal emotional aspects of the review beyond just the spoken words, and video consists of facial expressions, gestures, and overall body language provide additional cues to the reviewer's sentiment.MuSe-CaR aims to advance research in multimodal sentiment analysis by providing a rich dataset for training and evaluating models capable of understanding complex human emotions and opinions expressed through various modalities.Research Paper: The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Car Reviews (MuSe-CaR) Dataset: Collection, Insights and ImprovementsAuthors: Lukas Stappen, Alice Baird, Lea Schumann, Björn SchullerDataset Size: 40 hours of user-generated video material with more than 350 reviews and 70 host speakers (as well as 20 overdubbed narrators) from YouTube.Licence: End User Licence Agreement (EULA)Access Links: Muse Challenge WebsiteCLEVRCLEVR, which stands for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning, is a multimodal dataset designed to evaluate a machine learning model's ability to reason about the physical world using both visual information and natural language. It is a synthetic multimodal dataset created to test AI systems' ability to perform complex reasoning about visual scenes. CLEVR combines two modalities, visual and textual. Visual modality comprises rendered 3D scenes containing various objects. Each scene features a simple background and a set of objects with distinct properties like shape (cube, sphere, cylinder), size (large, small), color (gray, red, blue, etc.), and material (rubber, metal).  Textual modality consists of questions posed in natural language about the scene. These questions challenge models to not only \"see\" the objects but also understand their relationships and properties to answer accurately.CLEVR is used in applications like visual reasoning in robotics and other domains to understand the spatial relationships between objects in real-time (e.g., \"Which object is in front of the blue rubber cube?\"), counting and comparison to enumerate objects with specific properties (e.g., \"How many small spheres are there?\"), and  logical reasoning to understand the scene and the question to arrive at the correct answer, even if the answer isn't directly visible (e.g., \"The rubber object is entirely behind a cube. What color is it?\").Research Paper: CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual ReasoningAuthors: Justin Johnson, Bharath Hariharan, Laurens van der Maaten, Fei-Fei Li, Larry Zitnick, Ross GirshickDataset Size: 100,000  images, 864986 questions, 849,980 answers, 85,000 scene graph annotations and functional program representations.Licence: Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 licence.Access Links: Stanford University CLEVR PageInternVid InternVid is a relatively new multimodal dataset specifically designed for tasks related to video understanding and generation using generative models.

      "In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.[1] Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions,[2] through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided into multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation, and test sets.\n",
      "The model is initially fit on a training data set,[3] which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model.[4] The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.\n",
      "Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set.[3] The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters[5] (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network[4]). Validation data sets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).[6]\n",
      "This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation data set's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.[6]\n",
      "Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set.[5] If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term \"validation set\" is sometimes used instead of \"test set\" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).[5]\n",
      "Deciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Training data set[edit]\n",
      "Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins, which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual features. The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them.Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left):[8] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin.In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes.\n",
      "A training data set is a data set of examples used during the learning process and is used to fit the parameters (e.g., weights) of, for example, a classifier.[9][10]\n",
      "For classification tasks, a supervised learning algorithm looks at the training data set to determine, or learn, the optimal combinations of variables that will generate a good predictive model.[11] The goal is to produce a trained (fitted) model that generalizes well to new, unknown data.[12] The fitted model is evaluated using “new” examples from the held-out data sets (validation and test data sets) to estimate the model’s accuracy in classifying new data.[5] To reduce the risk of issues such as over-fitting, the examples in the validation and test data sets should not be used to train the model.[5]\n",
      "Most approaches that search through training data for empirical relationships tend to overfit the data, meaning that they can identify and exploit apparent relationships in the training data that do not hold in general.\n",
      "When a training set is continuously expanded with new data, then this is incremental learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Validation data set[edit]\n",
      "A validation data set is a data set of examples used to tune the hyperparameters (i.e. the architecture) of a model. It is sometimes also called the development set or the \"dev set\".[13] An example of a hyperparameter for artificial neural networks includes the number of hidden units in each layer.[9][10] It, as well as the testing set (as mentioned below), should follow the same probability distribution as the training data set.\n",
      "In order to avoid overfitting, when any classification parameter needs to be adjusted, it is necessary to have a validation data set in addition to the training and test data sets. For example, if the most suitable classifier for the problem is sought, the training data set is used to train the different candidate classifiers, the validation data set is used to compare their performances and decide which one to take and, finally, the test data set is used to obtain the performance characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and so on. The validation data set functions as a hybrid: it is training data used for testing, but neither as part of the low-level training nor as part of the final testing.\n",
      "The basic process of using a validation data set for model selection (as part of training data set, validation data set, and test data set) is:[10][14]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since our goal is to find the network having the best performance on new data, the simplest approach to the comparison of different networks is to evaluate the error function using data which is independent of that used for training. Various networks are trained by minimization of an appropriate error function defined with respect to a training data set. The performance of the networks is then compared by evaluating the error function using an independent validation set, and the network having the smallest error with respect to the validation set is selected. This approach is called the hold out method. Since this procedure can itself lead to some overfitting to the validation set, the performance of the selected network should be confirmed by measuring its performance on a third independent set of data called a test set.\n",
      "An application of this process is in early stopping, where the candidate models are successive iterations of the same network, and training stops when the error on the validation set grows, choosing the previous model (the one with minimum error).\n",
      "\n",
      "Test data set[edit]\n",
      "A test data set is a data set that is independent of the training data set, but that follows the same probability distribution as the training data set. If a model fit to the training data set also fits the test data set well, minimal overfitting has taken place (see figure below). A better fitting of the training data set as opposed to the test data set usually points to over-fitting.\n",
      "A test set is therefore a set of examples used only to assess the performance (i.e. generalization) of a fully specified classifier.[9][10] To do this, the final model is used to predict classifications of examples in the test set. Those predictions are compared to the examples' true classifications to assess the model's accuracy.[11]\n",
      "In a scenario where both validation and test data sets are used, the test data set is typically used to assess the final model that is selected during the validation process. In the case where the original data set is partitioned into two subsets (training and test data sets), the test data set might assess the model only once (e.g., in the holdout method).[15] Note that some sources advise against such a method.[12] However, when using a method such as cross-validation, two partitions can be sufficient and effective since results are averaged after repeated rounds of model training and testing to help reduce bias and variability.[5][12]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A training set (left) and a test set (right) from the same statistical population are shown as blue points.  Two predictive models are fit to the training data.  Both fitted models are plotted with both the training and test sets.  In the training set, the MSE of the fit shown in orange is 4 whereas the MSE for the fit shown in green is 9.  In the test set, the MSE for the fit shown in orange is 15 and the MSE for the fit shown in green is 13.  The orange curve severely overfits the training data, since its MSE increases by almost a factor of four when comparing the test set to the training set.  The green curve overfits the training data much less, as its MSE increases by less than a factor of 2.\n",
      "Confusion in terminology[edit]\n",
      "Testing is trying something to find out about it (\"To put to the proof; to prove the truth, genuineness, or quality of by experiment\" according to the Collaborative International Dictionary of English) and to validate is to prove that something is valid (\"To confirm; to render valid\" Collaborative International Dictionary of English). With this perspective, the most common use of the terms test set and validation set is the one here described. However, in both industry and academia, they are sometimes used interchanged, by considering that the internal process is testing different models to improve (test set as a development set) and the final model is the one that needs to be validated before real use with an unseen data (validation set). \"The literature on machine learning often reverses the meaning of 'validation' and 'test' sets. This is the most blatant example of the terminological confusion that pervades artificial intelligence research.\"[16] Nevertheless, the important concept that must be kept is that the final set, whether called test or validation, should only be used in the final experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross-validation[edit]\n",
      "In order to get more stable results and use all valuable data for training, a data set can be repeatedly split into several training and a validation data sets. This is known as cross-validation. To confirm the model's performance, an additional test data set held out from cross-validation is normally used.\n",
      "It is possible to use cross-validation on training and validation sets, and within each training set have further cross-validation for a test set for hyperparameter tuning. This is known as nested cross-validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Causes of error[edit]\n",
      "Comic strip demonstrating a fictional erroneous computer output (making a coffee 5 million degrees, from a previous definition of \"extra hot\"). This can be classified as both a failure in logic and a failure to include various relevant environmental conditions.[17]\n",
      "Omissions in the training of algorithms are a major cause of erroneous outputs.[17] Types of such omissions include:[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "Particular circumstances or variations were not included.\n",
      "Obsolete data\n",
      "Ambiguous input information\n",
      "Inability to change to new environments\n",
      "Inability to request help from a human or another AI system when needed\n",
      "An example of an omission of particular circumstances is a case where a boy was able to unlock the phone because his mother registered her face under indoor, nighttime lighting, a condition which was not appropriately included in the training of the system.[17][18]\n",
      "Usage of relatively irrelevant input can include situations where algorithms use the background rather than the object of interest for object detection, such as being trained by pictures of sheep on grasslands, leading to a risk that a different object will be interpreted as a sheep if located on a grassland.[17]\n",

      "A machine learning model is a program that can find patterns or make decisions from a previously unseen dataset. For example, in natural language processing, machine learning models can parse and correctly recognize the intent behind previously unheard sentences or combinations of words. In image recognition, a machine learning model can be taught to recognize objects - such as cars or dogs. A machine learning model can perform such tasks by having it 'trained' with a large dataset. During training, the machine learning algorithm is optimized to find certain patterns or outputs from the dataset, depending on the task. The output of this process - often a computer program with specific rules and data structures - is called a machine learning model.\n",

      "Read nowWhat is a machine learning Algorithm?\n",
      "A machine learning algorithm is a mathematical method to find patterns in a set of data. Machine Learning algorithms are often drawn from statistics, calculus, and linear algebra. Some popular examples of machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and XGBoost.\n",
      "What is Model Training in machine learning?\n",
      "The process of running a machine learning algorithm on a dataset (called training data) and optimizing the algorithm to find certain patterns or outputs is called model training. The resulting function with rules and data structures is called the trained machine learning model.\n",
      "What are the different types of Machine Learning?\n",
      "In general, most machine learning techniques can be classified into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
      "What is Supervised Machine Learning?\n",
      "In supervised machine learning, the algorithm is provided an input dataset, and is rewarded or optimized to meet a set of specific outputs. For example, supervised machine learning is widely deployed in image recognition, utilizing a technique called classification. Supervised machine learning is also used in predicting demographics such as population growth or health metrics, utilizing a technique called regression.\n",
      "What is Unsupervised Machine Learning?\n",
      "In unsupervised machine learning, the algorithm is provided an input dataset, but not rewarded or optimized to specific outputs, and instead trained to group objects by common characteristics. For example, recommendation engines on online stores rely on unsupervised machine learning, specifically a technique called clustering.\n",
      "What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
      "In reinforcement learning, the algorithm is made to train itself using many trial and error experiments. Reinforcement learning happens when the algorithm interacts continually with the environment, rather than relying on training data. One of the most popular examples of reinforcement learning is autonomous driving.\n",
      "What are the different machine learning models?\n",
      "There are many machine learning models, and almost all of them are based on certain machine learning algorithms. Popular classification and regression algorithms fall under supervised machine learning, and clustering algorithms are generally deployed in unsupervised machine learning scenarios.\n",
      "Supervised Machine Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is used to determine if an input belongs to a certain group or not\n",
      "SVM: SVM, or Support Vector Machines create coordinates for each object in an n-dimensional space and uses a hyperplane to group objects by common features\n",
      "Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is an algorithm that assumes independence among variables and uses probability to classify objects based on features\n",
      "Decision Trees: Decision trees are also classifiers that are used to determine what category an input falls into by traversing the leaf's and nodes of a tree\n",
      "Linear Regression: Linear regression is used to identify relationships between the variable of interest and the inputs, and predict its values based on the values of the input variables.\n",
      "kNN: The k Nearest Neighbors technique involves grouping the closest objects in a dataset and finding the most frequent or average characteristics among the objects.\n",
      "Random Forest: Random forest is a collection of many decision trees from random subsets of the data, resulting in a combination of trees that may be more accurate in prediction than a single decision tree.\n",
      "Boosting algorithms: Boosting algorithms, such as Gradient Boosting Machine, XGBoost, and LightGBM, use ensemble learning. They combine the predictions from multiple algorithms (such as decision trees) while taking into account the error from the previous algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsupervised Machine Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "K-Means: The K-Means algorithm finds similarities between objects and groups them into K different clusters.\n",
      "Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of nested clusters without having to specify the number of clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a Decision Tree in Machine Learning (ML)?\n",
      "A Decision Tree is a predictive approach in ML to determine what class an object belongs to. As the name suggests, a decision tree is a tree-like flow chart where the class of an object is determined step-by-step using certain known conditions.  A decision tree visualized in the Databricks Lakehouse. Source: https://www.databricks.com/blog/2019/05/02/detecting-financial-fraud-at-scale-with-decision-trees-and-mlflow-on-databricks.html\n",
      "What is Regression in Machine Learning?\n",
      "Regression in data science and machine learning is a statistical method that enables predicting outcomes based on a set of input variables. The outcome is often a variable that depends on a combination of the input variables.  A linear regression model performed on the Databricks Lakehouse. Source: https://www.databricks.com/blog/2015/06/04/simplify-machine-learning-on-spark-with-databricks.html\n",
      "What is a Classifier in Machine Learning?\n",
      "A classifier is a machine learning algorithm that assigns an object as a member of a category or group. For example, classifiers are used to detect if an email is spam, or if a transaction is fraudulent.\n",
      "How many models are there in machine learning?\n",
      "Many! Machine learning is an evolving field and there are always more machine learning models being developed.\n",
      "What is the best model for machine learning?\n",
      "The machine learning model most suited for a specific situation depends on the desired outcome. For example, to predict the number of vehicle purchases in a city from historical data, a supervised learning technique such as linear regression might be most useful. On the other hand, to identify if a potential customer in that city would purchase a vehicle, given their income and commuting history, a decision tree might work best.\n",
      "What is model deployment in Machine Learning (ML)?\n",
      "Model deployment is the process of making a machine learning model available for use on a target environment—for testing or production. The model is usually integrated with other applications in the environment (such as databases and UI) through APIs. Deployment is the stage after which an organization can actually make a return on the heavy investment made in model development.  A full machine learning model lifecycle on the Databricks Lakehouse.

      "What are Deep Learning Models?\n",
      "Deep learning models are a class of ML models that imitate the way humans process information. The model consists of several layers of processing (hence the term 'deep') to extract high-level features from the data provided. Each processing layer passes on a more abstract representation of the data to the next layer, with the final layer providing a more human-like insight. Unlike traditional ML models which require data to be labeled, deep learning models can ingest large amounts of unstructured data. They are used to perform more human-like functions such as facial recognition and natural language processing.  A simplified representation of deep learning. Source: https://www.databricks.com/discover/pages/the-democratization-of-artificial-intelligence-and-deep-learning \n",
      "What is Time Series Machine Learning?\n",
      "A time-series machine learning model is one in which one of the independent variables is a successive length of time minutes, days, years etc.), and has a bearing on the dependent or predicted variable. Time series machine learning models are used to predict time-bound events, for example - the weather in a future week, expected number of customers in a future month, revenue guidance for a future year, and so on.\n",

Healthcare organizations, insurance companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, corporate organizations; all need data to develop and test the quality of software and applications. But in most cases, their (production) data consists of personal and privacy sensitive information and the databases are often huge and therefore inconvenient for testing. That’s where test data comes in. But what is it and how is it created?Content Test data definitionThe creation of test dataTest data preparationTest data managementDownload ebookThe definition of test data“Data needed for test execution.”That’s the short definition. A slightly more detailed description is given by the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB):“Data created or selected to satisfy the execution preconditions and input content required to execute one or more test cases.”There is a lot of attention to development models and testing methods like security testing, performance testing, or regression testing. Testing agile and test automation are also hot topics these days. But how to handle the data (automated or not) which you need for testing software is addressed less often. That is actually quite strange since software development and testing would stand or fall on carefully prepared data cases. You can’t use just some data or just a random test case. In order to test a software application effectively, you’ll need a good and representative data set. The ideal test set identifies all the application errors with the smallest possible data set. In short, you need a relatively small (test) data set that is realistic, valid, and versatile.How to create test dataData can be created 1) manually, 2) by using test data generation tools, or 3) it can be retrieved from an existing production environment. The data set can consist of synthetic (fake) data, but preferably it consists of representative (real) data (for security reasons this data should of course be masked) with good coverage of the test cases. This will provide the best software quality and that is what we all want ultimately.So beware with dummy data, generated by a random name generator or a credit card number generator for example. These generators provide you with sample data that offers no challenges to the software being tested. Of course, synthetic data can be used to enrich and/or mask your test database.“The ideal test data identifies all the application errors with a smallest possible data set.”Test data challenges in software testingThe preparation of data for testing is a very time-consuming phase in software testing. Various research indicates that 30-60% of a tester’s time is dedicated to searching, maintaining, and generating data for testing and development. The main reasons for this are the following:Testing teams do not have access to the data sourcesDelay in giving production data access to the testers by developersLarge volumes of dataData dependencies/combinationsLong refreshment times1. Testing teams do not have access to the data sourcesEspecially with the GDPR, PCI, HIPAA, and other data security regulations in place, access to data sources is limited. As a result, only a few employees are able to access the data sources. The advantage of this policy is that the chance of a data breach is reduced. The disadvantage is that test teams are dependent on others and that long waiting times arise.2. Delay in giving production data access to the testers by developersAgile is not yet being used everywhere. In many organizations, multiple teams and users work on the same project and thus on the same databases. Besides that it causes conflicts, the data set often changes and doesn’t contain the right (up-to-date) data when it’s the next team’s turn to test the application.3. Large volumes of dataCompiling data from a production database is like searching for a pin in a haystack. You need the special cases to perform good tests and they are hard to find when you have to dig in dozens of terabytes.4. Data dependencies/combinationsMost data values are dependent on other data values in order to get recognized. When preparing the cases, these dependencies make it a lot more complex and therefore time-consuming.5. Long refreshment timesMost testing teams do not have the facility to self-refresh the test database. That means that they have to go to the DBA to ask for refreshment. Some teams have to wait for days or even weeks before this refresh is done.Test data needs in software testingThere are many ways to test software code, or the end product. From unit to acceptance, from manual testing to a fully automated framework. Every software testing method has its own specific demands and needs regarding test data. Whether you perform black box testing or white box testing, functional testing or integration testing – data sets are what you need in your test environment.How to prepare test data for testing: Test Data Management (TDM)Because TDM can be complex and expensive, some organizations stick to old habits. The test teams (have to) accept that:Data isn’t refreshed often (or ever);It doesn’t contain all the data quality issues present in production;A high percentage of bugs/faults in test cases is related to the data.That is a shame and totally unnecessary because it doesn’t have to be complex and high-quality test data pays for itself. Simple techniques help you to save a lot of time and money. In addition, it ensures good tests and therefore high-quality software.Here are some tips that may help:1. Identify the source of the problemBefore you can fix a problem, you need to understand its cause. Is your data incomplete, inconsistent, biased, or noisy? Is it generated by a flawed process or a poorly designed system? Is it outdated or irrelevant? By diagnosing the root cause of your data issues, you can avoid wasting time and resources on ineffective solutions.2. Clean up your dataOnce you know what’s wrong with your data, you can start cleaning it up. This may involve removing duplicates, filling in missing values, correcting errors, or transforming variables. Depending on the size and complexity of your data, you may need to use specialized tools or techniques, such as data wrangling, data imputation, or data augmentation. You may also need to consult domain experts or subject matter specialists to ensure that your data reflects the real world.3. Generate synthetic dataIf your data is too small, too biased, or too sensitive to share, you may need to mask it and/or generate synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of your real data. However, you need to be careful not to introduce new biases or artifacts that may affect your results.4. Collaborate with othersSometimes, the best way to improve your data is to work with others who have complementary skills and perspectives. This may involve collaborating with data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, or business stakeholders who can help you gather, process, or interpret your data. In conclusion, dealing with bad quality test data can be frustrating, but it’s not a hopeless situation. By using the right tools, techniques, and collaborations, you can turn your data into a valuable asset that improves your testing outcomes and your business outcomes.Download EbookThe Power of Test Data Management Ebook - The Power of Test Data Management\"*\" indicates required fieldsName*Company*Role*RoleDatabase AdministratorSoftware Quality EngineerTest ManagerIT ManagerData Protection OfficerTest Tool EngineerOtherEmail* Talk to an expert I want to talk to a test data expertBy submitting this form you agree to DATPROF's Privacy Policy.

      "Machine Learning models are very powerful resources that automate multiple tasks and make them more accurate and efficient. ML handles new data and scales the growing demand for technology with valuable insight. It improves the performance over time. This cutting-edge technology has various benefits such as faster processing or response, enhancement of decision-making, and specialized services. In this article, we will discuss Machine Learning Models, their types, How Machine Learning works, Real-world examples of ML Models, and the Future of Machine Learning Models. Machine Leraning ModelsA model of machine learning is a set of programs that can be used to find the pattern and make a decision from an unseen dataset. These days NLP (Natural language Processing) uses the machine learning model to recognize the unstructured text into usable data and insights. You may have heard about image recognition which is used to identify objects such as boy, girl, mirror, car, dog, etc. A model always requires a dataset to perform various tasks during training. In training duration, we use a machine learning algorithm for the optimization process to find certain patterns or outputs from the dataset based upon tasks. Table of Content\n",

Reinforcement learning Models4.1 Value-based learning:4.2 Policy-based learning:Deep LearningHow Machine Learning Works?Advanced Machine Learning ModelsReal-world examples of ML Models Future of Machine Learning ModelsConclusionTypes of Machine Learning ModelsMachine learning models can be broadly categorized into four main paradigms based on the type of data and learning goals:1. Supervised ModelsSupervised learning is the study of algorithms that use labeled data in which each data instance has a known category or value to which it belongs. This results in the model to discover the relationship between the input features and the target outcome.1.1 ClassificationThe classifier algorithms are designed to indicate whether a new data point belongs to one or another among several predefined classes. Imagine when you are organising emails into spam or inbox, categorising images as cat or dog, or predicting whether a loan applicant is a credible borrower. In the classification models, there is a learning process by the use of labeled examples from each category. In this process, they discover the correlations and relations within the data that help to distinguish class one from the other classes. After learning these patterns, the model is then capable of assigning these class labels to unseen data points.Common Classification Algorithms:Logistic Regression: A very efficient technique for the classification problems of binary nature (two types, for example, spam/not spam).Support Vector Machine (SVM): Good for tasks like classification, especially when the data has a large number of features.Decision Tree: Constructs a decision tree having branches and proceeds to the class predictions through features.Random Forest: The model generates an \"ensemble\" of decision trees that ultimately raise the accuracy and avoid overfitting (meaning that the model performs great on the training data but lousily on unseen data).K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Assigns a label of the nearest neighbors for a given data point.1.2 RegressionRegression algorithms are about forecasting of a continuous output variable using the input features as their basis. This value could be anything such as predicting real estate prices or stock market trends to anticipating customer churn (how likely customers stay) and sales forecasting. Regression models make the use of features to understand the relationship among the continuous features and the output variable. That is, they use the pattern that is learned to determine the value of the new data points.Common Regression AlgorithmsLinear Regression: Fits depth of a line to the data to model for the relationship between features and the continuous output.Polynomial Regression: Similiar to linear regression but uses more complex polynomial functions such as quadratic, cubic, etc, for accommodating non-linear relationships of the data.Decision Tree Regression: Implements a decision tree-based algorithm that predicts a continuous output variable from a number of branching decisions.Random Forest Regression: Creates one from several decision trees to guarantee error-free and robust regression prediction results.Support Vector Regression (SVR): Adjusts the Support Vector Machine ideas for regression tasks, where we are trying to find one hyperplane that most closely reflects continuous output data.2. Unsupervised ModelsUnsupervised learning involves a difficult task of working with data which is not provided with pre-defined categories or label.2.1 ClusteringVisualize being given a basket of fruits with no labels on them. The fruits clustering algorithms are to group them according to the inbuilt similarities. Techniques like K-means clustering are defined by exact number of clusters (\"red fruits\" and \"green fruits\") and then each data point (fruit) is assigned to the cluster with the highest similarity within based on features (color, size, texture). Contrary to this, hierarchical clustering features construction of hierarchy of clusters which makes it more easy to study the system of groups. Spatial clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) detects groups of high-density data points, even in those areas where there is a lack of data or outliers.2.2 Dimensionality ReductionSometimes it is difficult to both visualize and analyze the data when you have a large feature space (dimensions). The purpose of dimensionality reduction methods is to decrease the dimensions needed to maintain the key features. Dimensions of greatest importance are identified by principal component analysis (PCA), which is the reason why data is concentrated in fewer dimensions with the highest variations. This speeds up model training as well as offers a chance for more efficient visualization. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) also resembles PCA but it is made for classification tasks where it concentrates on dimensions that can differentiate the present classes in the dataset.2.3 Anomaly DetectionUnsupervised learning can also be applied to find those data points which greatly differ than the majorities. The statistics model may identify these outliers, or anomalies as signaling of errors, fraud or even something unusual. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) makes a comparison of a given data point's local density with those surrounding it. It then flags out the data points with significantly lower densities as outliers or potential anomalies. Isolation Forest is the one which uses different approach, which is to recursively isolate data points according to their features. Anomalies usually are simple to contemplate as they often necessitate fewer steps than an average normal point.3. Semi-Supervised ModelBesides, supervised learning is such a kind of learning with labeled data that unsupervised learning, on the other hand, solves the task where there is no labeled data. Lastly, semi-supervised learning fills the gap between the two. It reveals the strengths of both approaches by training using data sets labeled along with unlabeled one. This is especially the case when labeled data might be sparse or prohibitively expensive to acquire, while unlabeled data is undoubtedly available in abundance.3.1 Generative Semi-Supervised LearningEnvision having a few pictures of cats with labels and a universe of unlabeled photos. The big advantage of generative semi-supervised learning is its utilization of such a scenario. It exploits a generative model to investigate the unlabeled pictures and discover the orchestrating factors that characterize the data. This technique can then be used to generate the new synthetic data points that have the same features with the unlabeled data. The synthetic data is then labeled with the pseudo-labels that the generative model has interpreted from the data. This approach combines the existing labeled data with the newly generated labeled data to train the final model which is likely to perform better than the previous model that was trained with only the limited amount of the original labeled data.3.2 Graph-based Semi-Supervised LearningThis process makes use of the relationships between data points and propagates labels to unmarked ones via labeled ones. Picture a social network platform where some of the users have been marked as fans of sports (labeled data). Cluster-based methods can analyze the links between users (friendships) and even apply this information to infer that if a user is connected to someone with a \"sports\" label then this user might also be interested in sports (unbiased labels with propagated label). While links and the entire structure of the network are also important for the distribution of labels. This method is beneficial when the data points are themselves connected to each other and this connection can be exploiting during labelling of new data.4. Reinforcement learning ModelsReinforcement learning takes a dissimilar approach from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Different from supervised learning or just plain discovery of hidden patterns, reinforcement learning adopt an agent as it interacts with the surrounding and learns. This agent is a learning one which develops via experiment and error, getting rewarded for the desired actions and punished for the undesired ones. The main purpose is to help players play the game that can result in the highest rewards.4.1 Value-based learning:Visualize a robot trying to find its way through a maze. It has neither a map nor instructions, but it gets points for consuming the cheese at the end and fails with deduction of time when it runs into a wall. Value learning is an offshoot of predicting the anticipated future reward of taking a step in a particular state. For example, the algorithm Q-learning will learn a Q-value for each state-action combination. This Q-value is the expected reward for that action at that specific state. Through a repetitive process of assessing the state, gaining rewards, and updating the Q-values the agent manages to determine that which actions are most valuable in each state and eventually guides it to the most rewarding path. In contrast, SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) looks at the value of the succeeding state-action pair that influences the exploration strategy.4.2 Policy-based learning:In contrast to the value-based learning, where we are learning a specific value for each state-action pair, in policy-based learning we are trying to directly learn a policy which maps states to actions. This policy in essence commands the agent to act in different situations as specified by the way it is written. Actor-Critic is a common approach that combines two models: an actor that retrains the policy and a critic that retrains the value function (just like value-based methods). The actor witnesses the critic's feedback which updates the policy that the actor uses for better decision making. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a specific policy-based method which focuses on high variance issues that complicate early policy-based learning methods.Deep LearningDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to achieve complex pattern recognition. These networks are particularly effective for tasks involving large amounts of data, such as image recognition and natural language processing. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - This is a popular model that refers to the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes based on various layers and is used for various ML tasks.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - A CNN is a deep learning model that automates the spatial hierarchies of features from input data. This model is commonly used in image recognition and classification. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - This model is designed for the processing of sequential data. It enables the memory input which is known for Neural network architectures.Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) - This model is comparatively similar to Recurrent Neural Networks and allows learners to learn the long-term dependencies from sequential data.How Machine Learning Works?Model Represntation: Machine Learning Models are represented by mathematical functions that map input data to output predictions. These functions can take various forms, such as linear equations, decision trees , or complex neural networks. Learning Algorithm: The learning algorithm is the main part of behind the model's ability to learn from data. It adjusts the parameters of the model's mathematical function iteratively during the training phase to minimize the difference between the model's prediction and the actual outcomes in the training data .Training Data: Training data is used to teach the model to make accurate predictions. It consists of input features(e.g variables, attributes) and corresponding output labels(in supervised learning) or is unalabeled(in supervised learning). During training , the model analyzes the patterns in the training data to update its parameters accordingly. Objective Function: The objective function, also known as the loss function, measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes in the training data. The goal during training is to minimize this function, effectively reducing the errors in the model's predictions.Optimization Process: Optimization is the process of finding the set of model parameters that minimize the objective function. This is typically achieved using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, which iteratively adjusts the model's parameters in the direction that reduces the objective function.Generalization: Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on a separate set of data called the validation or test set to assess its performance on new, unseen data. The model's ability to perform well on data it hasn't seen before is known as generalization.Final Output: After training and validation, the model can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. This process, known as inference, involves applying the trained model to new input data to generate predictions or classifications.Advanced Machine Learning ModelsNeural Networks: You must have heard about deep neural network which helps solve complex problems of data. It is made up of interconnected nodes of multiple layers which we also call neurons. Many things have been successful from this model such as image recognition, NLP, and speech recognition.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): This is a type of model that is built in the framework of a neural network and it is made to handle data that are of symbolic type, like images. From this model, the hierarchy of spatial features can be determined.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): These can be used to process data that is sequentially ordered, such as reading categories or critical language. These networks are built with loops in their architectures that allow them to store information over time.Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs): LSTMs, which are a type of RNNs, recognize long-term correlation objects. These models do a good job of incorporating information organized into long categories.Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are a type of neural networks that generate data by studying two networks over time. A product generates network data, while a determination attempts to distinguish between real and fake samples.Transformer Models: This model become popular in natural language processing. These models process input data over time and capture long-range dependencies.Real-world examples of ML ModelsThe ML model uses predictive analysis to maintain the growth of various Industries-Financial Services: Banks and financial institutions are using machine learning models to provide better services to their customers. Using intelligent algorithms, they understand customers' investment preferences, speed up the loan approval process, and receive alerts for non-ordinary transactions.Healthcare: In medicine, ML models are helpful in disease prediction, treatment recommendations, and prognosis. For example, physicians can use a machine learning model to predict the right cold medicine for a patient.Manufacturing Industry: In the manufacturing sector, ML has made the production process more smooth and optimized. For example, Machine Learning is being used in automated production lines to increase production efficiency and ensure manufacturing quality.Commercial Sector: In the marketing and marketing sector, ML models analyze huge data and predict production trends. This helps in understanding the marketing system and the products can be customized for their target customers. Future of Machine Learning ModelsThere are several important aspects to consider when considering the challenges and future of machine learning models. One challenge is that there are not enough resources and tools available to contextualize large data sets. Additionally, machine learning models need to be updated and restarted to understand new data patterns.In the future, another challenge for machine learning may be to collect and aggregate collections of data between different existing technology versions. This can be important for scientific development along with promoting the discovery of new possibilities. Finally, good strategy, proper resources, and technological advancement are important concepts for success in developing machine learning models. To address all these challenges, appropriate time and attention is required to further expand machine learning capabilities.ConclusionWe first saw the introduction of machine learning in which we know what a model is and what is the benefit of implementing it in our system. Then look at the history and evolution of machine learning along with the selection criteria to decide which model to use specifically. Next, we read data preparation where you can read all the steps. Then we researched advanced model that has future benefits but some challenges can also be faced but the ML model is a demand for the future.\n",

The function `transfer_learning` takes a model, pretraining and target datasets, the device to use for training, and the number of epochs for pre-training and fine-tuning. It updates the model's weights through both phases and returns the fine-tuned model. This approach is intended to leverage knowledge from related tasks to improve the model's performance on the target task.

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "### User's Problem\n",
      "The user aims to develop a human activity recognition (HAR) system using the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) dataset. This dataset includes accelerometer data collected from smartphones, which can be used to identify human activities. The task involves preprocessing the WISDM data, dividing it into training and testing parts, constructing a machine learning model for activity recognition, and finally evaluating the model's average recognition accuracy on the test dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Code\n",
      "The provided code is a Python script that implements a HAR system using the PyTorch framework. The script is designed to run on systems with a powerful GPU and uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms to classify accelerometer data into activity categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "### Installation\n",
      "Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:\n",

      "- Pandas\n",
      "- SciPy\n",
      "- scikit-learn\n",
      "\n",
      "You can install the required libraries using pip:\n",
      "```\n",
      "pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn torch\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Usage\n",
      "To use the HAR system, follow these steps:\n",
      "1. Place the `WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt` file in an accessible directory.\n",
      "2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
      "3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.\n",
      "4. Run the script using the following command:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   python har_system.py -i path_to_WISDM_dataset_file\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Replace `path_to_WISDM_dataset_file` with the actual path to your `WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt` file.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Troubleshooting\n",
      "- If you encounter any errors regarding missing libraries, make sure all the required libraries are installed.\n",
      "- Ensure that your GPU drivers and CUDA (if using NVIDIA GPUs) are up to date for optimal performance.\n",
      "- If you receive an out-of-memory error, try reducing the batch size or using a simpler model.\n",

      "\n",
      "### load_and_preprocess_data Function\n",
      "Responsible for loading the WISDM dataset from the provided file path, preprocessing it using z-score normalization, segmenting it into windows, and encoding the labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "### main Function\n",
      "The entry point of the script, where the data is loaded, preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and fed into the model for training and evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Command Line Argument Parsing\n",
      "Allows the user to specify the path to the dataset file when running the script from the command line.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Q: Can I use the code with a different dataset?**\n",
      "A: Yes, but you may need to adjust the preprocessing function to fit the format of your dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How can I improve the model's accuracy?**\n",
      "A: You can experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters (such as learning rate and batch size), or even augment the dataset to improve the model's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: What should I do if the model is overfitting?**\n",
      "A: Consider using techniques such as dropout, regularization, or reducing the complexity of the model to combat overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: The code is running slow, what can I do?**\n",
