      "             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms & UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

It includes over 3,780 video clips featuring 11 action categories, making it the first dataset focused on human actions in dark videos. The ARID dataset is an important resource for researchers and practitioners working on improving action recognition algorithms in challenging lighting conditions.DAHLIA - Daily Human Life ActivityDAHLIA dataset is focused on human activity recognition for smart-home services, such as user assistance.Videos were recorded in realistic conditions, with 3 Kinect v2 sensors located as they would be in a real context. The long-range activities were performed in an unconstrained way (participants received only a few instructions) and in a continuous (untrimmed) sequence, resulting in long videos (40 min on average per subject).Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data SetThe Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set is a publicly available dataset that contains sensor readings from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope captured during six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.The dataset includes 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measurements captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The sensor data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist while performing the activities. Each volunteer was asked to perform each activity for approximately 2-3 minutes, resulting in 10,299 instances.Final thoughtsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing technology with many applications. HAR recognizes and classifies human activities and movements using machine-learning techniques and sensors. It can transform various sectors, including healthcare, sports performance analysis, gaming, intelligent monitoring, and human/computer interface. Yet, to meet ethical and privacy concerns, the creation and execution of HAR must be done ethically and transparently. It is essential to guarantee that the data utilized to train and assess HAR algorithms is representative, diverse, and unbiased. The article also discussed how deep learning-based HAR approaches outperform conventional algorithms for machine learning, highlighting the outlines of CNN, CNN-LSTM, and RNN.In conclusion,  HAR has the potential to alter our daily lives and have a significant beneficial effect on society as it evolves and improves.

      "IntroductionHuman activity recognition (HAR) refers to using computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. HAR involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various forms of human motion, including activities, gestures, and behaviors. This data is then translated into actionable commands that computers can execute and analyze using HAR algorithms.Human activity recognition (HAR) has numerous applications across various domains. In healthcare, HAR can monitor and assess patients' movements and activities to detect abnormalities, track rehabilitation progress, or provide personalized care.\n",
      "           Figure: Human Activity RecognitionIn sports and athletics, HAR can analyze athletes' performance, provide feedback on technique, and prevent injuries by identifying improper movements. HAR also finds application in surveillance systems, which can automatically detect and classify suspicious or abnormal activities for enhanced security. Vision-based HAR systems often employ pose estimation techniques, which provide valuable insights into human behavior. Pose estimation is crucial in tasks like HAR, content extraction, and semantic comprehension. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks, are commonly used in pose estimation.One of the significant challenges in HAR is considering various factors such as physical attributes, cultural markers, direction, and pose types. For instance, distinguishing between a person falling and attempting a handstand can be difficult.Addressing this uncertainty requires the development of novel methods within the artificial intelligence framework.Researchers are exploring techniques such as multi-modal and graph-based learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems. These approaches involve incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between different body parts.In addition, to pose estimation and model complexity, HAR faces other challenges. Disparities in sensor data due to the placement of sensors, variations in human movement patterns, overlapping activities that interfere with accurate recognition, noisy data causing distortions, and the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection methods are some of the prominent challenges in the field.What is Pose Estimation?Pose estimation is a task in computer vision that involves determining the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video. It can be thought of as the process of inferring the pose based on the given visual data. This is achieved by identifying and tracking specific points, known as key points, on the object or person of interest.\n",
      "             Figure: Pose EstimationThese key points can be significant features or joints, such as corners for objects or major joints like elbows or knees for humans. By analyzing these key points' spatial relationships and movements, pose estimation algorithms can estimate the pose accurately.How Does AI-Based Human Activity Recognition Work?AI-based human activity recognition utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze sensor data and identify and classify human activities. The major steps involved include:Data CollectionData PreprocessingModel Selection and TrainingThis section focuses on a pipeline for how general Human Activity Recogonition is developed. 1.  Data CollectionHAR data is commonly gathered using sensors attached to or worn by the user. These sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.Accelerometers can detect changes in motion and direction and measure velocity along three axes (x, y, and z). On the other hand, Magnetometers can perceive magnetic fields and their orientation, while gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors can provide information about the user's location and movement, although they are not frequently used in HAR due to their high power consumption and limited accuracy indoors.The sensor data collected is typically recorded as time-series data, where each sample represents the sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second).2. Data PreprocessingData preprocessing is a critical stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) as it plays a fundamental role in cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw sensor data for subsequent analysis and modeling. The following are key processes involved in data preparation:i) FilteringFiltering is a signal processing technique that removes noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. In HAR, various filters are applied depending on the frequency range of the signals of interest. Commonly used filters include low-pass filters, which allow low-frequency components to pass while attenuating high-frequency noise; high-pass filters, which suppress low-frequency noise and emphasize high-frequency variations; and band-pass filters, which selectively allow a specific range of frequencies to pass, effectively filtering out unwanted signals and enhancing the desired signals.ii) Feature extractionThe choice of features depends on the specific actions and the type of sensors used. For example, features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties (e.g., Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters) can be extracted with accelerometer data.These features capture essential characteristics of the motion patterns and provide relevant information for activity recognition.iii) Feature selectionFeature selection aims to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative and discriminative features. The performance and efficiency of activity identification algorithms can be improved by selecting the most relevant features. Features are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish between different activities, association with activity labels, and redundancy with other features.iv) Data SegmentationData Segmentation involves dividing the continuous stream of sensor data into smaller segments or windows to capture the temporal aspects of activities. The size and overlap of the windows depend on the duration and intensity of the activities being monitored. Segmentation enables the analysis of activity patterns within shorter time intervals, facilitating the extraction of meaningful features from specific activity segments.v) Data NormalizationData Normalization is a process that scales the features to have a standardized mean and variance, typically aiming for a mean of zero and a variance of one. This step ensures that the features from different sensors or participants are on a comparable scale, preventing any biases introduced by variations in sensor sensitivity or participant characteristics.vi) Dimensionality reductionDimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. PCA identifies the most significant components of the data, capturing the maximum variance and allowing for a lower-dimensional representation. t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that aims to preserve the local structure of the data, enabling visualization of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.vii) Missing Value ImputationMissing value imputation addresses the issue of incomplete sensor data, which can occur due to device malfunctions or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches, such as mean or median interpolation, can estimate missing values based on the available data, ensuring the data is complete and ready for analysis.viii) Data PreparationData preparation is a crucial stage in HAR as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of activity identification models. By effectively preprocessing the sensor data, removing noise, extracting informative features, and reducing dimensionality, researchers and practitioners can enhance the precision and dependability of HAR systems, leading to more robust and accurate activity recognition results.3. Model SelectionSeveral machine learning models have been successfully applied in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks. Let's delve into some popular models used in detail:i) Decision TreesDecision Trees are simple yet effective models for classification tasks in HAR. They create a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. Decision trees can handle continuous and categorical data and capture non-linear interactions among features. They provide interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting when the data is complex or noisy.ii) Random ForestRandom Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It creates a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data with random feature subsets. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from individual trees. Random forests can handle noisy and high-dimensional data and are robust against overfitting. They are computationally efficient and can handle missing values. However, they may require more computational resources compared to decision trees.iii) Support Vector Machines (SVMs)SVMs are potent models for linear and non-linear classification tasks in HAR. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between them. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and are less prone to overfitting. They work well even with small to medium-sized datasets and can handle both continuous and categorical features.iv) Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)HMMs are statistical models widely used in HAR for recognizing sequential patterns in sensor data. They are particularly suitable for time-series data where the temporal dependencies between observations are important. HMMs consist of hidden states representing different activities and observed emissions corresponding to sensor measurements. They can capture the dynamics and transitions between different activities, making them effective for modeling complex activities with multiple steps.v) Neural NetworksActivity classification involves predicting future values from past data using statistical techniques and is commonly used for forecasting and analyzing sensor data. In human activity recognition, neural networks have shown great effectiveness. Two widely used approaches for this task are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. Below we discuss both of these approaches in brief.Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)RNN models are particularly well-suited for handling time-series data. They can process sequences of variable lengths, making them ideal for activity recognition. Classifying activities using RNN models involves vectorizing video files, calculating descriptors to represent activity characteristics, forming a visual bag of words, feeding the descriptors into input layers, analyzing and classifying the data using RNN layers, and obtaining the final result.\n",
      "     Figure: General Architecture for Recurrent Neural NetworksRNNs have been successfully employed in various applications, such as predicting pedestrian movements using camera and GPS data.2.  Convolutional Neural NetworkOn the other hand, CNN models are specialized neural networks known for their effectiveness in processing visual data. They are resilient to changes in scale, rotation, and other variations. CNNs have been widely used in image recognition, automatic number plate reading, and self-driving car software. An example of their application in human activity recognition is a 3D CNN algorithm that accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional pose of animals without the need for attached markers. This method proves beneficial for observing animals in both laboratory and wildlife settings. The training process involves assembling a dataset of synchronized video frames with labeled anatomical landmarks and training the CNN using this data.Some Important Datasets for Human Activity RecognitionIn this section, we discuss various datasets that can be used to train a computer vision model for Human Activity recognition.UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: This dataset contains data from smartphones' accelerometers and gyroscope sensors, capturing various activities performed by different subjects.

In the gaming industry, Xsens technology captures players' movements and translates them into in-game actions.ConclusionHuman activity recognition (HAR) is a field that uses computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. It involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various human activities, gestures, and behaviors. HAR has applications in healthcare, sports, surveillance, and other domains.HAR relies on techniques such as pose estimation, which determines the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video by identifying key points or joints. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for pose estimation.Data collection for HAR involves using accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors, which capture motion, direction, and location information. The collected sensor data is then preprocessed by filtering out noise, extracting relevant features, segmenting the data, normalizing the features, and reducing dimensionality.HAR model selection includes decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and neural networks. Decision trees and random forests provide interpretability and handle complex data, SVMs handle high-dimensional data, HMMs are suitable for time-series data, and neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and CNNs, are effective for handling time-series and visual data, respectively.Several datasets are commonly used for HAR research, including the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, KTH Human Activity Recognition Dataset, UCF101, HMDB51, and ActivityNet.Real-life applications of HAR include healthcare and wellness monitoring, sports performance analysis, security and surveillance systems, industrial safety monitoring, and enhancing the gaming experience.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)What are the different types of human activity recognition?Different types of human activity recognition include Sensor-Based Activity Recognition, Single-User Activity Recognition, Multi-User Activity Recognition, and Group Activity Recognition.What is the meaning of activity recognition?Activity recognition refers to predicting human movement or activities based on sensor data, typically from devices like smartphone accelerometers.

      "             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms & UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

The sensor data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist while performing the activities. Each volunteer was asked to perform each activity for approximately 2-3 minutes, resulting in 10,299 instances.Final thoughtsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing technology with many applications. HAR recognizes and classifies human activities and movements using machine-learning techniques and sensors. It can transform various sectors, including healthcare, sports performance analysis, gaming, intelligent monitoring, and human/computer interface. Yet, to meet ethical and privacy concerns, the creation and execution of HAR must be done ethically and transparently. It is essential to guarantee that the data utilized to train and assess HAR algorithms is representative, diverse, and unbiased. The article also discussed how deep learning-based HAR approaches outperform conventional algorithms for machine learning, highlighting the outlines of CNN, CNN-LSTM, and RNN.In conclusion,  HAR has the potential to alter our daily lives and have a significant beneficial effect on society as it evolves and improves.

      "IntroductionHuman activity recognition (HAR) refers to using computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. HAR involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various forms of human motion, including activities, gestures, and behaviors. This data is then translated into actionable commands that computers can execute and analyze using HAR algorithms.Human activity recognition (HAR) has numerous applications across various domains. In healthcare, HAR can monitor and assess patients' movements and activities to detect abnormalities, track rehabilitation progress, or provide personalized care.\n",
      "           Figure: Human Activity RecognitionIn sports and athletics, HAR can analyze athletes' performance, provide feedback on technique, and prevent injuries by identifying improper movements. HAR also finds application in surveillance systems, which can automatically detect and classify suspicious or abnormal activities for enhanced security. Vision-based HAR systems often employ pose estimation techniques, which provide valuable insights into human behavior. Pose estimation is crucial in tasks like HAR, content extraction, and semantic comprehension. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks, are commonly used in pose estimation.One of the significant challenges in HAR is considering various factors such as physical attributes, cultural markers, direction, and pose types. For instance, distinguishing between a person falling and attempting a handstand can be difficult.Addressing this uncertainty requires the development of novel methods within the artificial intelligence framework.Researchers are exploring techniques such as multi-modal and graph-based learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems. These approaches involve incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between different body parts.In addition, to pose estimation and model complexity, HAR faces other challenges. Disparities in sensor data due to the placement of sensors, variations in human movement patterns, overlapping activities that interfere with accurate recognition, noisy data causing distortions, and the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection methods are some of the prominent challenges in the field.What is Pose Estimation?Pose estimation is a task in computer vision that involves determining the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video. It can be thought of as the process of inferring the pose based on the given visual data. This is achieved by identifying and tracking specific points, known as key points, on the object or person of interest.\n",
      "             Figure: Pose EstimationThese key points can be significant features or joints, such as corners for objects or major joints like elbows or knees for humans. By analyzing these key points' spatial relationships and movements, pose estimation algorithms can estimate the pose accurately.How Does AI-Based Human Activity Recognition Work?AI-based human activity recognition utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze sensor data and identify and classify human activities. The major steps involved include:Data CollectionData PreprocessingModel Selection and TrainingThis section focuses on a pipeline for how general Human Activity Recogonition is developed. 1.  Data CollectionHAR data is commonly gathered using sensors attached to or worn by the user. These sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.Accelerometers can detect changes in motion and direction and measure velocity along three axes (x, y, and z). On the other hand, Magnetometers can perceive magnetic fields and their orientation, while gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors can provide information about the user's location and movement, although they are not frequently used in HAR due to their high power consumption and limited accuracy indoors.The sensor data collected is typically recorded as time-series data, where each sample represents the sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second).2. Data PreprocessingData preprocessing is a critical stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) as it plays a fundamental role in cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw sensor data for subsequent analysis and modeling. The following are key processes involved in data preparation:i) FilteringFiltering is a signal processing technique that removes noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. In HAR, various filters are applied depending on the frequency range of the signals of interest. Commonly used filters include low-pass filters, which allow low-frequency components to pass while attenuating high-frequency noise; high-pass filters, which suppress low-frequency noise and emphasize high-frequency variations; and band-pass filters, which selectively allow a specific range of frequencies to pass, effectively filtering out unwanted signals and enhancing the desired signals.ii) Feature extractionThe choice of features depends on the specific actions and the type of sensors used. For example, features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties (e.g., Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters) can be extracted with accelerometer data.These features capture essential characteristics of the motion patterns and provide relevant information for activity recognition.iii) Feature selectionFeature selection aims to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative and discriminative features. The performance and efficiency of activity identification algorithms can be improved by selecting the most relevant features. Features are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish between different activities, association with activity labels, and redundancy with other features.iv) Data SegmentationData Segmentation involves dividing the continuous stream of sensor data into smaller segments or windows to capture the temporal aspects of activities. The size and overlap of the windows depend on the duration and intensity of the activities being monitored. Segmentation enables the analysis of activity patterns within shorter time intervals, facilitating the extraction of meaningful features from specific activity segments.v) Data NormalizationData Normalization is a process that scales the features to have a standardized mean and variance, typically aiming for a mean of zero and a variance of one. This step ensures that the features from different sensors or participants are on a comparable scale, preventing any biases introduced by variations in sensor sensitivity or participant characteristics.vi) Dimensionality reductionDimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. PCA identifies the most significant components of the data, capturing the maximum variance and allowing for a lower-dimensional representation. t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that aims to preserve the local structure of the data, enabling visualization of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.vii) Missing Value ImputationMissing value imputation addresses the issue of incomplete sensor data, which can occur due to device malfunctions or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches, such as mean or median interpolation, can estimate missing values based on the available data, ensuring the data is complete and ready for analysis.viii) Data PreparationData preparation is a crucial stage in HAR as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of activity identification models. By effectively preprocessing the sensor data, removing noise, extracting informative features, and reducing dimensionality, researchers and practitioners can enhance the precision and dependability of HAR systems, leading to more robust and accurate activity recognition results.3. Model SelectionSeveral machine learning models have been successfully applied in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks. Let's delve into some popular models used in detail:i) Decision TreesDecision Trees are simple yet effective models for classification tasks in HAR. They create a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. Decision trees can handle continuous and categorical data and capture non-linear interactions among features. They provide interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting when the data is complex or noisy.ii) Random ForestRandom Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It creates a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data with random feature subsets. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from individual trees. Random forests can handle noisy and high-dimensional data and are robust against overfitting. They are computationally efficient and can handle missing values. However, they may require more computational resources compared to decision trees.iii) Support Vector Machines (SVMs)SVMs are potent models for linear and non-linear classification tasks in HAR. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between them. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and are less prone to overfitting. They work well even with small to medium-sized datasets and can handle both continuous and categorical features.iv) Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)HMMs are statistical models widely used in HAR for recognizing sequential patterns in sensor data. They are particularly suitable for time-series data where the temporal dependencies between observations are important. HMMs consist of hidden states representing different activities and observed emissions corresponding to sensor measurements. They can capture the dynamics and transitions between different activities, making them effective for modeling complex activities with multiple steps.v) Neural NetworksActivity classification involves predicting future values from past data using statistical techniques and is commonly used for forecasting and analyzing sensor data. In human activity recognition, neural networks have shown great effectiveness. Two widely used approaches for this task are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. Below we discuss both of these approaches in brief.Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)RNN models are particularly well-suited for handling time-series data. They can process sequences of variable lengths, making them ideal for activity recognition. Classifying activities using RNN models involves vectorizing video files, calculating descriptors to represent activity characteristics, forming a visual bag of words, feeding the descriptors into input layers, analyzing and classifying the data using RNN layers, and obtaining the final result.\n",
      "     Figure: General Architecture for Recurrent Neural NetworksRNNs have been successfully employed in various applications, such as predicting pedestrian movements using camera and GPS data.2.  Convolutional Neural NetworkOn the other hand, CNN models are specialized neural networks known for their effectiveness in processing visual data. They are resilient to changes in scale, rotation, and other variations. CNNs have been widely used in image recognition, automatic number plate reading, and self-driving car software. An example of their application in human activity recognition is a 3D CNN algorithm that accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional pose of animals without the need for attached markers. This method proves beneficial for observing animals in both laboratory and wildlife settings. The training process involves assembling a dataset of synchronized video frames with labeled anatomical landmarks and training the CNN using this data.Some Important Datasets for Human Activity RecognitionIn this section, we discuss various datasets that can be used to train a computer vision model for Human Activity recognition.UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: This dataset contains data from smartphones' accelerometers and gyroscope sensors, capturing various activities performed by different subjects.

It includes untrimmed videos annotated with activity labels, enabling research in activity recognition and temporal localization tasks.These datasets are widely utilized resources for researchers and developers in the field of human activity recognition, facilitating the evaluation and advancement of HAR algorithms and techniques.Real-Life Applications of Human Activity RecognitionIn the below section, we discuss some use cases of Human Activity Recogonition along with their real-life implementations.1. Human Activity Recognition in Health Monitoring ApplicationHealthcare and Wellness: HAR Techniques can monitor patient activities and detects abnormal behavior or changes in daily routines.\n",
      "Figure: Human Activity Recognition in Health Monitoring ApplicationFor example, HAR is widely used to monitor medication adherence by analyzing patient activities through smartphone sensors.Through Remote patient engagement and assessment methods, which include the measurement of digital biomarkers and real-time monitoring of medication dosing, adherence to prescribed medications can be ensured. The dosing support solution operates through a smartphone application, where patients receive alerts reminding them to take their medication and are guided through the correct administration process. One such company is AICure which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics to oversee patient behavior and facilitate remote engagement in clinical trials.2) Applications of Human Activity Recognition in the Sports and Fitness IndustryHAR is employed in the sports and fitness industry for sports performance analysis to track and evaluate athletes' movements and techniques. HAR is mostly utilized to provide insights into player performance, injury prevention, and training optimization.This is primarily achieved using wearable tracking devices and data analytics. These devices, such as GPS trackers and inertial sensors, are designed to collect various metrics during training or competition, including player movement, speed, acceleration, deceleration, and positional data. This data is then transmitted wirelessly to a central system for analysis.The central system employs advanced data analytics algorithms to process and interpret the collected data. It provides valuable insights into athlete performance, workload, and injury risk. Coaches, trainers, and sports scientists can access this information through user-friendly dashboards and visualizations to make data-driven decisions and optimize training strategies.\n",

They focus on developing innovative wearable devices and software solutions that empower individuals and organizations to track and analyze human movement data.Through wearable devices, statistical data demonstrates a significant reduction in manual injuries by 50-60% while increasing working efficiency by an impressive 72%. These advantages highlight the positive impact of wearable technology on workplace safety and productivity.5) Application of HAR in the Gaming IndustryHuman activity recognition (HAR) has several applications in the gaming industry, enhancing the gaming experience and enabling more immersive gameplay. With the help of HAR, systems accurately track and recognize various human activities, such as running, jumping, punching, or swinging a sword.This data is then used to control and animate the in-game characters, allowing players to engage in virtual environments using their own body movements.Xsens is a leading provider of 3D motion capture technology and solutions. They offer a range of products and software that enable real-time human motion tracking and analysis. In the gaming industry, Xsens technology captures players' movements and translates them into in-game actions.ConclusionHuman activity recognition (HAR) is a field that uses computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. It involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various human activities, gestures, and behaviors. HAR has applications in healthcare, sports, surveillance, and other domains.HAR relies on techniques such as pose estimation, which determines the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video by identifying key points or joints. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for pose estimation.Data collection for HAR involves using accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors, which capture motion, direction, and location information. The collected sensor data is then preprocessed by filtering out noise, extracting relevant features, segmenting the data, normalizing the features, and reducing dimensionality.HAR model selection includes decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and neural networks. Decision trees and random forests provide interpretability and handle complex data, SVMs handle high-dimensional data, HMMs are suitable for time-series data, and neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and CNNs, are effective for handling time-series and visual data, respectively.Several datasets are commonly used for HAR research, including the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, KTH Human Activity Recognition Dataset, UCF101, HMDB51, and ActivityNet.Real-life applications of HAR include healthcare and wellness monitoring, sports performance analysis, security and surveillance systems, industrial safety monitoring, and enhancing the gaming experience.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)What are the different types of human activity recognition?Different types of human activity recognition include Sensor-Based Activity Recognition, Single-User Activity Recognition, Multi-User Activity Recognition, and Group Activity Recognition.What is the meaning of activity recognition?Activity recognition refers to predicting human movement or activities based on sensor data, typically from devices like smartphone accelerometers.

      "             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms & UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

      "IntroductionHuman activity recognition (HAR) refers to using computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. HAR involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various forms of human motion, including activities, gestures, and behaviors. This data is then translated into actionable commands that computers can execute and analyze using HAR algorithms.Human activity recognition (HAR) has numerous applications across various domains. In healthcare, HAR can monitor and assess patients' movements and activities to detect abnormalities, track rehabilitation progress, or provide personalized care.\n",
      "           Figure: Human Activity RecognitionIn sports and athletics, HAR can analyze athletes' performance, provide feedback on technique, and prevent injuries by identifying improper movements. HAR also finds application in surveillance systems, which can automatically detect and classify suspicious or abnormal activities for enhanced security. Vision-based HAR systems often employ pose estimation techniques, which provide valuable insights into human behavior. Pose estimation is crucial in tasks like HAR, content extraction, and semantic comprehension. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks, are commonly used in pose estimation.One of the significant challenges in HAR is considering various factors such as physical attributes, cultural markers, direction, and pose types. For instance, distinguishing between a person falling and attempting a handstand can be difficult.Addressing this uncertainty requires the development of novel methods within the artificial intelligence framework.Researchers are exploring techniques such as multi-modal and graph-based learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems. These approaches involve incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between different body parts.In addition, to pose estimation and model complexity, HAR faces other challenges. Disparities in sensor data due to the placement of sensors, variations in human movement patterns, overlapping activities that interfere with accurate recognition, noisy data causing distortions, and the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection methods are some of the prominent challenges in the field.What is Pose Estimation?Pose estimation is a task in computer vision that involves determining the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video. It can be thought of as the process of inferring the pose based on the given visual data. This is achieved by identifying and tracking specific points, known as key points, on the object or person of interest.\n",
      "             Figure: Pose EstimationThese key points can be significant features or joints, such as corners for objects or major joints like elbows or knees for humans. By analyzing these key points' spatial relationships and movements, pose estimation algorithms can estimate the pose accurately.How Does AI-Based Human Activity Recognition Work?AI-based human activity recognition utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze sensor data and identify and classify human activities. The major steps involved include:Data CollectionData PreprocessingModel Selection and TrainingThis section focuses on a pipeline for how general Human Activity Recogonition is developed. 1.  Data CollectionHAR data is commonly gathered using sensors attached to or worn by the user. These sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.Accelerometers can detect changes in motion and direction and measure velocity along three axes (x, y, and z). On the other hand, Magnetometers can perceive magnetic fields and their orientation, while gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors can provide information about the user's location and movement, although they are not frequently used in HAR due to their high power consumption and limited accuracy indoors.The sensor data collected is typically recorded as time-series data, where each sample represents the sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second).2. Data PreprocessingData preprocessing is a critical stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) as it plays a fundamental role in cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw sensor data for subsequent analysis and modeling. The following are key processes involved in data preparation:i) FilteringFiltering is a signal processing technique that removes noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. In HAR, various filters are applied depending on the frequency range of the signals of interest. Commonly used filters include low-pass filters, which allow low-frequency components to pass while attenuating high-frequency noise; high-pass filters, which suppress low-frequency noise and emphasize high-frequency variations; and band-pass filters, which selectively allow a specific range of frequencies to pass, effectively filtering out unwanted signals and enhancing the desired signals.ii) Feature extractionThe choice of features depends on the specific actions and the type of sensors used. For example, features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties (e.g., Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters) can be extracted with accelerometer data.These features capture essential characteristics of the motion patterns and provide relevant information for activity recognition.iii) Feature selectionFeature selection aims to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative and discriminative features. The performance and efficiency of activity identification algorithms can be improved by selecting the most relevant features. Features are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish between different activities, association with activity labels, and redundancy with other features.iv) Data SegmentationData Segmentation involves dividing the continuous stream of sensor data into smaller segments or windows to capture the temporal aspects of activities. The size and overlap of the windows depend on the duration and intensity of the activities being monitored. Segmentation enables the analysis of activity patterns within shorter time intervals, facilitating the extraction of meaningful features from specific activity segments.v) Data NormalizationData Normalization is a process that scales the features to have a standardized mean and variance, typically aiming for a mean of zero and a variance of one. This step ensures that the features from different sensors or participants are on a comparable scale, preventing any biases introduced by variations in sensor sensitivity or participant characteristics.vi) Dimensionality reductionDimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. PCA identifies the most significant components of the data, capturing the maximum variance and allowing for a lower-dimensional representation. t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that aims to preserve the local structure of the data, enabling visualization of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.vii) Missing Value ImputationMissing value imputation addresses the issue of incomplete sensor data, which can occur due to device malfunctions or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches, such as mean or median interpolation, can estimate missing values based on the available data, ensuring the data is complete and ready for analysis.viii) Data PreparationData preparation is a crucial stage in HAR as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of activity identification models. By effectively preprocessing the sensor data, removing noise, extracting informative features, and reducing dimensionality, researchers and practitioners can enhance the precision and dependability of HAR systems, leading to more robust and accurate activity recognition results.3. Model SelectionSeveral machine learning models have been successfully applied in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks. Let's delve into some popular models used in detail:i) Decision TreesDecision Trees are simple yet effective models for classification tasks in HAR. They create a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. Decision trees can handle continuous and categorical data and capture non-linear interactions among features. They provide interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting when the data is complex or noisy.ii) Random ForestRandom Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It creates a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data with random feature subsets. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from individual trees. Random forests can handle noisy and high-dimensional data and are robust against overfitting. They are computationally efficient and can handle missing values. However, they may require more computational resources compared to decision trees.iii) Support Vector Machines (SVMs)SVMs are potent models for linear and non-linear classification tasks in HAR. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between them. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and are less prone to overfitting. They work well even with small to medium-sized datasets and can handle both continuous and categorical features.iv) Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)HMMs are statistical models widely used in HAR for recognizing sequential patterns in sensor data. They are particularly suitable for time-series data where the temporal dependencies between observations are important. HMMs consist of hidden states representing different activities and observed emissions corresponding to sensor measurements. They can capture the dynamics and transitions between different activities, making them effective for modeling complex activities with multiple steps.v) Neural NetworksActivity classification involves predicting future values from past data using statistical techniques and is commonly used for forecasting and analyzing sensor data. In human activity recognition, neural networks have shown great effectiveness. Two widely used approaches for this task are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. Below we discuss both of these approaches in brief.Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)RNN models are particularly well-suited for handling time-series data. They can process sequences of variable lengths, making them ideal for activity recognition. Classifying activities using RNN models involves vectorizing video files, calculating descriptors to represent activity characteristics, forming a visual bag of words, feeding the descriptors into input layers, analyzing and classifying the data using RNN layers, and obtaining the final result.\n",
      "     Figure: General Architecture for Recurrent Neural NetworksRNNs have been successfully employed in various applications, such as predicting pedestrian movements using camera and GPS data.2.  Convolutional Neural NetworkOn the other hand, CNN models are specialized neural networks known for their effectiveness in processing visual data. They are resilient to changes in scale, rotation, and other variations. CNNs have been widely used in image recognition, automatic number plate reading, and self-driving car software. An example of their application in human activity recognition is a 3D CNN algorithm that accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional pose of animals without the need for attached markers. This method proves beneficial for observing animals in both laboratory and wildlife settings. The training process involves assembling a dataset of synchronized video frames with labeled anatomical landmarks and training the CNN using this data.Some Important Datasets for Human Activity RecognitionIn this section, we discuss various datasets that can be used to train a computer vision model for Human Activity recognition.UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: This dataset contains data from smartphones' accelerometers and gyroscope sensors, capturing various activities performed by different subjects.

      "PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library,[4][5][6] used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing,[7] originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.[8][9][10][11] It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, alongside others such as TensorFlow and PaddlePaddle,[12][13] offering free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.[14]\n",
      "A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot,[15] Uber's Pyro,[16] Hugging Face's Transformers,[17][18] and Catalyst.[19][20]\n",

      "History[edit]\n",
      "Meta (formerly known as Facebook) operates both PyTorch and Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (Caffe2), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project was created by Meta and Microsoft in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018.[22] In September 2022, Meta announced that PyTorch would be governed by the independent PyTorch Foundation, a newly created subsidiary of the Linux Foundation.[23]\n",
      "PyTorch 2.0 was released on 15 March 2023, introducing TorchDynamo, a Python-level compiler that makes code run up to 2x faster, along with significant improvements in training and inference performance across major cloud platforms.[24][25]\n",

      "PyTorch tensors[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Tensor (machine learning)\n",
      "PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (torch.Tensor) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU. PyTorch has also been developing support for other GPU platforms, for example, AMD's ROCm[26] and Apple's Metal Framework.[27]\n",
      "PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.[28]\n",
      "Note that the term \"tensor\" here does not carry the same meaning as tensor in mathematics or physics. The meaning of the word in machine learning is only superficially related to its original meaning as a certain kind of object in linear algebra. Tensors in PyTorch are simply multi-dimensional arrays.\n",

This module offers a comprehensive collection of building blocks for neural networks, including various layers and activation functions, enabling the construction of complex models. Networks are built by inheriting from the torch.nn module and defining the sequence of operations in the forward() function. \n",

Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms & UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

      "PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library,[4][5][6] used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing,[7] originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.[8][9][10][11] It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, alongside others such as TensorFlow and PaddlePaddle,[12][13] offering free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.[14]\n",
      "A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot,[15] Uber's Pyro,[16] Hugging Face's Transformers,[17][18] and Catalyst.[19][20]\n",

      "Meta (formerly known as Facebook) operates both PyTorch and Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (Caffe2), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project was created by Meta and Microsoft in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018.[22] In September 2022, Meta announced that PyTorch would be governed by the independent PyTorch Foundation, a newly created subsidiary of the Linux Foundation.[23]\n",
      "PyTorch 2.0 was released on 15 March 2023, introducing TorchDynamo, a Python-level compiler that makes code run up to 2x faster, along with significant improvements in training and inference performance across major cloud platforms.[24][25]\n",

      "PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (torch.Tensor) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU. PyTorch has also been developing support for other GPU platforms, for example, AMD's ROCm[26] and Apple's Metal Framework.[27]\n",
      "PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.[28]\n",
      "Note that the term \"tensor\" here does not carry the same meaning as tensor in mathematics or physics. The meaning of the word in machine learning is only superficially related to its original meaning as a certain kind of object in linear algebra. Tensors in PyTorch are simply multi-dimensional arrays.\n",

This module offers a comprehensive collection of building blocks for neural networks, including various layers and activation functions, enabling the construction of complex models.

Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms & UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

      "PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library,[4][5][6] used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing,[7] originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.[8][9][10][11] It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, alongside others such as TensorFlow and PaddlePaddle,[12][13] offering free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.[14]\n",
      "A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot,[15] Uber's Pyro,[16] Hugging Face's Transformers,[17][18] and Catalyst.[19][20]\n",

      "Meta (formerly known as Facebook) operates both PyTorch and Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (Caffe2), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project was created by Meta and Microsoft in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018.[22] In September 2022, Meta announced that PyTorch would be governed by the independent PyTorch Foundation, a newly created subsidiary of the Linux Foundation.[23]\n",
      "PyTorch 2.0 was released on 15 March 2023, introducing TorchDynamo, a Python-level compiler that makes code run up to 2x faster, along with significant improvements in training and inference performance across major cloud platforms.[24][25]\n",

      "PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (torch.Tensor) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU. PyTorch has also been developing support for other GPU platforms, for example, AMD's ROCm[26] and Apple's Metal Framework.[27]\n",
      "PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.[28]\n",
      "Note that the term \"tensor\" here does not carry the same meaning as tensor in mathematics or physics. The meaning of the word in machine learning is only superficially related to its original meaning as a certain kind of object in linear algebra. Tensors in PyTorch are simply multi-dimensional arrays.\n",

      "             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms & UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

The sensor data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist while performing the activities. Each volunteer was asked to perform each activity for approximately 2-3 minutes, resulting in 10,299 instances.Final thoughtsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing technology with many applications. HAR recognizes and classifies human activities and movements using machine-learning techniques and sensors. It can transform various sectors, including healthcare, sports performance analysis, gaming, intelligent monitoring, and human/computer interface. Yet, to meet ethical and privacy concerns, the creation and execution of HAR must be done ethically and transparently. It is essential to guarantee that the data utilized to train and assess HAR algorithms is representative, diverse, and unbiased. The article also discussed how deep learning-based HAR approaches outperform conventional algorithms for machine learning, highlighting the outlines of CNN, CNN-LSTM, and RNN.In conclusion,  HAR has the potential to alter our daily lives and have a significant beneficial effect on society as it evolves and improves.

The function `transfer_learning` takes a model, pretraining and target datasets, the device to use for training, and the number of epochs for pre-training and fine-tuning. It updates the model's weights through both phases and returns the fine-tuned model. This approach is intended to leverage knowledge from related tasks to improve the model's performance on the target task.

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "### User's Problem\n",
      "The user aims to develop a human activity recognition (HAR) system using the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) dataset. This dataset includes accelerometer data collected from smartphones, which can be used to identify human activities. The task involves preprocessing the WISDM data, dividing it into training and testing parts, constructing a machine learning model for activity recognition, and finally evaluating the model's average recognition accuracy on the test dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Code\n",
      "The provided code is a Python script that implements a HAR system using the PyTorch framework. The script is designed to run on systems with a powerful GPU and uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms to classify accelerometer data into activity categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "### Installation\n",
      "Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:\n",
      "- Python 3.x\n",
      "- PyTorch\n",
      "- NumPy\n",
      "- Pandas\n",
      "- SciPy\n",
      "- scikit-learn\n",
      "\n",
      "You can install the required libraries using pip:\n",
      "```\n",
      "pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn torch\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Usage\n",
      "To use the HAR system, follow these steps:\n",
      "1. Place the `WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt` file in an accessible directory.\n",
      "2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
      "3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.\n",
      "4. Run the script using the following command:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   python har_system.py -i path_to_WISDM_dataset_file\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Replace `path_to_WISDM_dataset_file` with the actual path to your `WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt` file.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Troubleshooting\n",
      "- If you encounter any errors regarding missing libraries, make sure all the required libraries are installed.\n",
      "- Ensure that your GPU drivers and CUDA (if using NVIDIA GPUs) are up to date for optimal performance.\n",
      "- If you receive an out-of-memory error, try reducing the batch size or using a simpler model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "The script is divided into several sections, each performing specific tasks:\n",
      "\n",
      "### AttentionModule Class\n",
      "Defines an attention mechanism for the LSTM outputs, which helps the model focus on the most relevant features for classification.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Q: Can I use the code with a different dataset?**\n",
      "A: Yes, but you may need to adjust the preprocessing function to fit the format of your dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How can I improve the model's accuracy?**\n",
      "A: You can experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters (such as learning rate and batch size), or even augment the dataset to improve the model's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: What should I do if the model is overfitting?**\n",
      "A: Consider using techniques such as dropout, regularization, or reducing the complexity of the model to combat overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: The code is running slow, what can I do?**\n",
